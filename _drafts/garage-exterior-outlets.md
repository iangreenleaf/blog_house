Exterior outlets are handy, and our garage didn't have any set up.
I fairly regularly use the driveway or back yard as a workspace for larger projects that involve corded power tools, and contractors also sometimes do the same.
There's an outlet block inside the garage that you can run an extension cord from, but it's not the most convenient, and you have to have the garage door open as long as it's plugged in.

I also wish for an exterior outlet annually when I hang Christmas lights.
My previous solution was extremely shameful: there's a hole in the garage wall where some of the siding around the security light has rotted away, and it's just big enough to wiggle a plug through.
So I would run an extension cord inside the garage from an outlet up to the hole, feed the plug for the Christmas lights through the hole, and plug it in.

I was thinking about this in December 2020 as I hung lights again, and I was on a roll with electrical work coming off my success [inside the garage](TODO).
So why not?
Let's install some exterior outlets.

The arrangement that sounded best to me was one box up near the eaves for lights, and another box at a more normal outlet height for everything else to be plugged in.
The corner of the garage nearest the house would be easy to reach with wire, and was a convenient location for both of those boxes.

It's common to set exterior outlets into the wall (similar to interior outlets), but I wanted to avoid cutting into the garage siding if I could avoid it.
It's in pretty poor shape and needs every bit of structural integrity it can get.
Plus, the narrow siding meant I might have a hard time getting a flat surface to mount the box properly flush and weathertight.
Luckily, it's possible to get surface-mount boxes for exterior use, so I chose that option.
[These ones](TODO) seemed like the popular choice and indeed, they are very good boxes.

I could have run all the wire inside the garage and drilled a separate hole to feed it to each box, but running the wire directly between the boxes via conduit sounded easier and more appealing, and would leave me one less run of wire to worry about inside the garage.
I did some research and determined that PVC conduit would be a good choice.
It's cheap, easy to work with, and rated for exterior applications.

I decided to orient the upper outlet sideways and the lower outlet the more traditional vertical.
Mostly because it just… felt right?
This would keep the upper box a little higher and more under the protection of the eave.
And if I ever wanted to add another run of conduit from this box, it would probably be around the corner to set something on the yard face of the garage, so this orientation would put the unused box port in the right place for that.
Doing it this way made the conduit run slightly more complicated, but not a big deal, just the addition of a 90° elbow.
The conduit run goes like this: a screw-in connector at the box, attached to the elbow, attached (with the "bell end") to a conduit section, attached to the screw-in connector at the other box.

Code calls for conduit to be supported every 3 feet, which meant I would need one conduit hanger, so I grabbed a pack of those too.
I'm sure I would have been fine without, but I might as well do things by the book.

Home Depot also suggested that I would need locknuts to secure the screw-in connectors on the inside of the box, but that turned out to be incorrect.
At least with these boxes, there was no place a locknut could attach, nor did it seem necessary.

These outlets should definitely be GFCI protected.
Luckily, I'd be feeding the wire from a box in the garage that had GFCI outlets, so I could run it off the load from one of those and have the whole circuit protected.
This meant I could buy a couple cheap weather-resistant outlets instead of pricier GFCIs.

I started by getting the layout worked out.
I marked a good spot for the upper outlet, making sure to leave space for the 90° conduit elbow.
This was where I wanted to feed the wire through the wall, so I also needed to make sure I placed it in a spot where I could drill straight through.
The upper box plus elbox determined the horizontal alignment of the lower box, so I picked a height that felt right (I decided to go a bit high to keep it above snow drifts) and marked that out.

Next, measure carefully and cut the conduit to size.
I had a pair of cheap PVC cutters already that made quick work of it, a little more convenient than using a tube cutter.
I did a full "dry fit" of all the pieces to make sure everything lined up.
That looked good, so it was time to make it permanent.

I read some advice that it's better to install boxes one at a time as you put together the conduit, rather than installing the boxes first and trying to fit the conduit in after.
I glued the elbox and conduit section to the upper box while off the wall, because it seemed easier than doing it in place.
I left the lower box off, to be installed after the first section was attached.
Apparently this conduit can be welded with a gray single-part PVC cement, but I already had a pack of the two-part primer/cement, and it said it was suitable for this, so I didn't bother buying the other cement.
This was my first time "welding" PVC.
I did drip primer everywhere because it was way runnier than I was expecting, but other than that it went smoothly and my joints look good.
I also went ahead and fed the wire that would connect the two boxes into the conduit at this point, since it was a little easier with unobstructed access to the ends.

To feed the inside wire to the box, I had another screw-in connector and a short piece of conduit.
This would insert through the siding and keep the connection fully weatherproof all the way through to the garage interior.
I had marked to spot for the hole when I was planning the box placement, and with just basic wood siding to deal with, all I needed to drill the hole was a spade bit.
Unfortunately, I didn't get the size of the hole right the first time and had to keep enlarging it (a task that spade bits do not do nearly as well as drilling a hole in the first place).
First I tried a 3/4" bit, thinking that would be the right outer diameter for 1/2" inner diameter conduit, but it turned out to be a little too small
 Then I bumped it up to 1", only to realize that the screw-in connector piece also needed to fit into the wall for the box to sit flush, and it was larger than 1".
I didn't want to jump up to 1 1/4" because that would have created extra space around the fitting, inviting water to leak in, so instead I used a Dremel to ream out the 1" hole just a bit, and used a utility knife to carve the little nubs off the connector.
I was a bit of a nuisance, but I did get everything to a nice tight fit where I could pound it into the wall and secure the box.
With the upper box screwed in, I glued the lower box to the other end of the conduit and screwed it into place as well.
A single conduit hanger to secure it and the structure is all set.

Now to install the outlets and wiring, and I gotta say, I'm getting better at it.
I only had to redo one thing, because I forgot to ground one of the boxes (the boxes, being metal, have their own ground screws in addition to the outlets).
It's a pretty simple run: attach to the "load" side of the existing interior GFCI, wire out to the upper outlet, and then a second wire from that outlet through the conduit to the lower outlet.
Finally, install the box covers, turn the power back on, test the outlets and test the GFCI breaker.
Done just in time for sunset!

This wasn't the biggest or most exciting project, but to me this is what DIY is all about.
Being able to customize our house like this means I can make the exact changes that will improve our lives.
We didn't need to add dozens of outlets all over, we just need to add a couple in this one spot.
It's a distinct upgrade to my convenience, and I didn't have to shell out hundreds of dollars for a house call from an electrician.
