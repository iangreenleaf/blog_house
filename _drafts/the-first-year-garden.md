title: The first-year garden
---

I had maintained a small garden at both of the last two places we rented, so now that we had a place of our own I was excited to get a garden going.
However, we closed on the house at the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that.
The timeline meant that I wasn't going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.

In a way, this was a blessing in disguise for me, because it forced me to temper my ambitions for the first year, and that gave me a whole growing season to observe and learn about the condition of the land.
Thus, when I did start making more permanent decisions I did so well-informed.
In the moment, though, it meant I had to get creative about what I could scrap together.

Already present was a small corner near the porch that was absolutely packed with hostas, and one small raised bed, oddly nestled against a juniper.
Not much to work with.

## The circle garden ##

There was one more feature in the yard that could have been a problem but instead I saw as an opportunity.
The previous residents had kept an enormous above-ground pool in the side yard for years.
The pool was gone when we moved in, but in its place was a large circular patch of totally bare dirt.
It was a good size for a garden, and planting it with vegetables was going to be a lot more fun than letting the weeds plant it.

I did a halfhearted job of double-digging the circle to loosen up the soil.
In the process I discovered that some sections of the space had about 8" of decent soil before hitting a layer of compacted rocks and rubbleâ€”this would be a recurring theme in the yard.
It was already past planting time, so as soon as it was ready I started putting things in the ground.
I had some seeds from previous years, and I bought some starts at the Friends Plant Sale and a couple neighborhood plant sales.
I also acquired a few plants from neighbors giving away extras, though one of those I would come to regret.

Planks salvaged from [the garage]({% post_url 2019-06-20-the-garage %}) formed makeshift paths, and I got a bale of straw from a garden center for mulch.

Rabbits started snipping things the moment I planted.
Luckily I was cruising the free section on Nextdoor pretty heavily around this time and had acquired some chicken wire and t-posts, so that made a makeshift fence.
At some point I got some landscape staples and used those to hold down the bottom of the fence, and that arrangement provided sufficient protection throughout the season.

## Bonus tomatoes ##

In addition to the circle garden, the small raised bed was available for use, so I planted it with tomatoes.
This bed didn't have any critter protection, but thankfully the rabbits around here have never shown any interest in tomato plants.
I had a motley assortment of tomato cages, some passed down from my father, some scavenged, and a few that came with the house.
They worked fine and the tomatoes did pretty well.

The juniper right next to the bed, however, got in the way of maintenance and harvesting.
I never figured out what the logic was in this placement.
The boards were also rotting and coming apart, so I didn't expect this bed to exist beyond this year.

## The sunchoke mistake ##

Sunchokes, also known as Jerusalem Artichokes, are a perennial relative of the sunflower with tasty edible tubers.
They are also often described as an aggressive spreader, to be treated with care.
I took these warnings too lightly and paid for it.

I had heard about sunchokes somewhere and was interested in them.
When someone on Nextdoor offered free baby plants dug from their yard, I biked over and grabbed a handful of starts, which I plopped in the middle of the circle garden.

Mistake #1: *Right* in the middle of the garden.
My thinking at the time was that they were taller so they could be flanked by shorter plants without blocking views or sun.
In retrospect, what I actually did was provide them with a ton of clear surface to colonize and no barriers to keep them contained.

Mistake #2: I suspect these sunchokes were a wild type.
There are cultivars that produce bigger tubers and spread less vigorously, but these were probably the undomesticated variety.
I've since reined in my use of free plants from neighbors, in large part because of this sort of loss of control over the finer details of what gets planted.

The sunchokes grew okay through the season, though they "lodged" (i.e. fell over) after enduring some moderate winds.
The first disappointment came when I dug them at the end of the season and discovered that they had created almost no edible tubers.
Their root systems contained a few tubers too tiny to be practical and a ton of rhizomes (long-distance horizontal roots), which sounds like foreshadowing because it was.

The real bad news arrived the following spring, when hundreds of volunteer sunchoke plants appeared all around the circle garden.
Not only were there a ton clustered around where I had planted the sunchokes the previous year, but seedlings were also showing up as far as five feet away.
Turns out all those rhizomes had placed little tubers all over the place, ready to colonize.
By this time, I had seeded the circle garden with native plants, and while sunchokes are technically a native, I didn't want them to dominate this area like they were clearly prepared to do.

How do you fight a sunchoke infestation?
It's not easy, but it's possible.
Mowing is an option, but it would have to be done very regularly to be effective---the sunchokes didn't mind being cut back too much and would quickly regrow.
Mulching would probably work, but I suspect it would have to be a very impenetrable layer to foil these vigorous plants.

I chose a war of attrition, making frequent patrols throughout the summer to pull up every sunchoke plant I found in the area.
More would sprout, and a week later I'd pull some more.
When I had time, I'd also use a trowel to dig out the tubers themselves so they couldn't just send up a new stem.
This strategy did eventually work, but it took a whole summer of frequent attention before I got things under control.

Luckily, I didn't let this ordeal put me off of growing sunchokes, and I have since planted some elsewhere that are now one of my favorite and most productive crops.
You should consider growing sunchokes too, but learn from my mistakes: grow a named cultivar, and situate it somewhere that is easy to control the spread.
