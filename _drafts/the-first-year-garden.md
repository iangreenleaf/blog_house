title: The first-year garden
---

I had maintained a small garden at both of the last two places we rented, so now that we had a place of our own I was excited to get a garden going.
However, we closed on the house near the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that.
The timeline meant that I wasn't going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.

In a way, this was a blessing in disguise for me, because it forced me to temper my ambitions for the first year, and that gave me a whole growing season to observe and learn about the condition of the land.
Thus, when I did start making more permanent decisions I did so well-informed.
In the moment, though, it meant I had to get creative about what I could scrap together.

Already present was a small corner near the porch that was absolutely packed with hostas, and one small raised bed, oddly nestled against a juniper.
Not much to work with.

## The circle garden ##

There was one more feature in the yard that could have been a problem but instead I saw as an opportunity.
The previous residents had kept an enormous above-ground pool in the side yard for years.
The pool was gone long before we moved in, but in its place was a large circular patch of totally bare dirt.
It was a good size for a garden, and planting it with vegetables was going to be a lot more fun than letting the weeds plant it.

I did a halfhearted job of double digging the circle to loosen up the soil.
In the process I discovered that some sections of the space had about 8" of decent soil before hitting a layer of compacted rocks and rubbleâ€”this would be a recurring theme in the yard.
It was already past planting time, so as soon as it was ready I started putting things in the ground.
I had some seeds from previous years, and I bought some starts at the Friends Plant Sale and a couple neighborhood plant sales.
I also acquired a few plants from neighbors giving away extras, though one of those I would come to regret.

Planks salvaged from [the garage]({% post_url 2019-06-20-the-garage %}) formed makeshift paths, and I got a bale of straw from a garden center for mulch.

Rabbits started snipping things the moment I planted.
Luckily I was cruising the free section on Nextdoor pretty heavily around this time and had acquired some chicken wire and t-posts, so that made a makeshift fence.
At some point I got some landscape staples and used those to hold down the bottom of the fence, and that arrangement provided sufficient protection throughout the season.
