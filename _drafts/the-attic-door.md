The best test of similar you are to me in personality is how much [this comic](https://xkcd.com/349/) resonates with you.
This phenomenon, known as ["yak shaving"](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html), comprises the majority of my waking hours.
Now, enjoy this story about how I installed the quarter round to trim our attic floor.

The attic floor was fully installed, the walls painted, the seams caulked.
The only task remaining before it could be considered complete was to install quarter round to finish the edge between the wall and floor.
This went smoothly as I started at the stairs and worked my way around the room.
The final section intersected the bathroom doorway before rejoining the stairs, and I would be finished.

However, the trim around the bathroom door was crappy, and I had been planning to replace that.
I better not cut the quarter round until I have new trim installed so I can ensure it's the correct length.
So I pulled the trim off, we'll get that sorted out and then back to the quarter round!
Of course, we know we want to install a door in this doorway so the bathroom can have some privacy.
It wouldn't make sense to re-trim it before I have the door set.
I inspect the door jamb and it turns out to be made of crappy particleboard product covered in a paper coating.
This must have been the absolute cheapest option on the rack.
It doesn't seem likely that I'll be able to securely set the hinge screws in this stuff, plus if the coating gets damaged while I modify it, it will be hell to try to get it back to a clean finish.
No way to fix that except to rip it out and start over.

So you see, before I could finish installing quarter round, I would have to build and install a custom-fitted door jamb.

## The fit ##

There was a reason the previous owners hadn't put a door on the bathroom: it was a challenge.
The attic space is encroached upon by the slope of the roof, and the bathroom gets some of that.
The doorway was installed at an angle, possibly to achieve the needed width for the opening, but even so, one corner is cut out to accommodate the ceiling.

The sloped ceiling also presented major difficulties in clearance for the door swing.
There are four ways we could hang the door, each with its own considerations.
It's also just difficult to visualize how the pieces will fit together when so many angles are involved.
Working all this out taxed my spatial reasoning skills to their utmost.

A left outswing had a clear path to work with, but when open the door would fall right across the top of the staircase, which seemed pretty inconvenient.
This was a fine option to hold as a last resort, but I wasn't crazy about it.

A right outswing would open the door against the outside wall.
It wouldn't sit totally flat due to the radiator on the wall, but this would still be a very convenient place for the door overall.
Unfortunately, the top of the door would hit the sloped ceiling long before it was fully open, so this option was out.

A left inswing would completely block the toilet when open, plus face the same ceiling clearance issue, so that was definitely out.

A right inswing was the most appealing option, as the open door would sit flat against the bathroom wall, convenient and out of the way.
One problem, though.
Remember how the door frame is set at an angle?
This meant that when you opened a right inswing door, the top left corner was heading not straight in but also somewhat towards the outside wall---the wall with the sloped ceiling that was already only a couple inches from the top corner of the frame.

If I got a door all the way installed only to discover that it couldn't open more than a couple inches before crunching into the ceiling, I'd be pretty hosed.
The corner of the door traces an arc as it opens, so if it gets far enough into the swing it will be pulled further away from the ceiling... but it needs to stay clear of the ceiling far enough for the curve of the arc to balance out the inward angle of the doorway.
And if you're getting really precise, you have to consider that the pivot point isn't actually the edge of the door, but a point in the hinge, a fraction of an inch behind the face of the door itself.
The mathematics of the situation seemed effectively impossible to work out, so I did the next best thing: a paper prototype!
I traced the funny dog-eared door shape onto a big piece of cardboard and cut it out to serve as a placeholder door.
Then I held this up and tried to keep the "hinge" side fixed in place while swinging it back and forth to simulate opening and closing the door.
Then I told Katherine to stop judging me, you'll thank me later.

Would a right inswing door clear the ceiling?
The experimental results came back with a firm "maybe".
The cardboard told me it was possible, but it was going to be very close.
Given all the complex interacting variables at play here, plus the fact that I had never hung any door by hand before, my confidence was not at a particularly high point.
But I wanted this, so I pushed on.

After more thinking and more torturous mental gymnastics and more cardboard waving, I determined that I could buy myself a couple precious inches by setting the door into the frame a bit, rather than flush with the inside of the jamb, as is traditional.
Doing this would create some new challenges, of course.
The round part of door hinges is wider than the plates, so for them to sit flat, I'd need to route out some part of the jamb to create an inset area.
Also, remember that since the doorway is at an angle, for the door to open all the way to the wall, it would need to be a bit more than 90°.
Would it clear the jamb and trim enough to do that?
The hinge adds a small bit of offset from jamb when open, but would it be enough?
Again, the mathematics of the situation seemed impossible, so I eyeballed it and decided that it would probably be okay, and I could always alter the jamb and trim a little more if I had to.

With the extra room provided by this hack, I felt good enough about the clearance to proceed with a right inswing.
Not *good*, mind you.
Just *good enough*.

## The jamb ##

Doors are not easy!
There's a lot that goes into the creation of a door that fits properly, latches properly, and doesn't swing on its own.
Most doors these days come pre-hung, but I was going to be doing this the old-school, from-scratch way.
Plus, to make it even more challenging, I'd have the nonstandard shape of the frame to deal with.

Thankfully, whoever had framed the doorway did a pretty good job.
It was set to a standard narrow door width, and the framing was very close to plumb and square.
Small mercies.
Due to the prevalence of pre-hung doors, there's not a ton of good educational content out there on hanging doors by hand.
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTnJZfdlG5E) was by far the best I found.
Yes, it's got a strong VHS aesthetic going on, but that carpenter is a wealth of knowledge.

I bought one of those door jamb kits from Home Depot that come with pre-cut and primed pieces.
$TODO is not a good price for some lumber when you consider the board-feet, but I needed it to be the standard 11/16" door jamb thickness for the dimensions to work out, and it seems that door jamb pieces are pretty much the only place that commodity lumber is sold in those dimensions.
Sure, in theory one could buy your own common boards and plane them to the correct thickness, and yes, that would be much cheaper, and yes, my father in law does own a planer... but look, even *I* know that there are some yaks you just can't shave.
As a further insult, once I started routing out the custom parts of the jamb, I discovered that those penny-pinchers aren't even selling full pine boards.
It's shorter sections of pine, finger jointed together to reach the proper length, and then slathered with some sort of thick hard priming goop to smooth over all the imperfections.
And of course that dumb primer stuff tends to chip when routed, making it more of a nuisance to work with than if it were a properly prepared pine board like it's supposed to be.
Ugh.
I'm still mad about this, obviously.

Using my fancy new router table, I routed out a portion of the hinge side to accommodate the hinge pins.
I had thought about routing only small oval insets just large enough for the pins, but that felt like it would look weird and this faux-reveal situation seemed like a better bet.
This took a while on the router, and might have been faster to resaw on a table saw, but I wasn't confident about the tolerances on my cheap table saw to be sure I would get a clean result.
And if I screwed it up on the table saw, I'd have to go back to Home Depot and pay another $TODO for another pack of stupid finger-jointed ill-fitted thick-primered jamb pieces.
No thank you!
I was still learning how to use the router table effectively, but this came out pretty well.
I only marred it with a couple light router bit marks in one spot, and those were easily covered up at the finish stage.

I had rough measurements for where the hinges would be, so to save a bit of time I freehand routered out a conservative opening for each of those and left the exact outline to be chiseled later.

Next, more measuring and more working out the proper miter angles so I could cut up the jamb pieces to fit the wacky angled corner.
I was very glad to have a little trim experience under my belt prior to this, since this sort of work is where it's easiest to make a measurement mistake, like counting from the wrong side of the miter.
The old pieces of particleboard jamb came in handy here for test-fitting my miter cuts, since they were the proper thickness and were just going in the trash anyways.
I did not work fast, but I did get good results.
Nice snug fits and clean miters on all but one of the joints.
The only place I didn't ace it was the angled ceiling piece, which I installed last.
When prepping I had overlooked the fact that the angled framing piece was slightly twisted out of line with the rest of the frame.
I was able to shim the jamb piece to correct this, but that threw my measurements off slightly, and since I was installing this piece last, it would have been very hard to correct.
So I ended up with one joint that doesn't quite match up.
Still, this is a pretty good result for such a weird situation (and a world better than the previous jamb).

## The trim ##

After all my grumbling about the jamb kit, it should not surprise you that I opted not to buy ready-made trim.
I don't like the aesthetics of most of the moulding sold at big box stores, and in this case I was going to need to do a lot of custom fitting anyhow.
The doorway is very close to several wall and ceiling intersections, leaving small and angled spaces for trim. The previous owners had fudged this with quarter round, and the results were pretty poor.
I wanted to do better, which meant having full control over the width of each trim piece.
Luckily, I had a serviceable table saw, and nice router and router table I had just purchased, and several 1" poplar boards I had picked up a while ago at a huge discount (probably because they were TODO" instead of a more common size).

I wanted to do a very simple trim style so as to look good with the tight space and not draw attention to itself.
I used some test pieces to experiment with different styles.
Based on this, I determined that a slight roundover on the vertical edges was all the ornamentation I felt it needed.
For the narrow angled pieces, I decided to rip them at angles, which should allow the outside edge to meet the adjoining wall rather than leaving a tiny gap.
Getting the fit right meant a painstaking process for each piece of measuring, calculating angles, ripping a test piece, and adjusting up to several times until the fit was perfect.

Just to make the whole thing even harder, I discovered that the drywall above the door has a significant inward bow, which meant the head casing didn't sit flat.
My options were to cut into the drywall or plane a whole lot of wood off the trim pieces to make them sit properly.
I opted to cut into the drywall, with guidance from my good friend [Vancouver Carpenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQHHfZqRTyE).

All this extra finesse made the whole process a lot more complicated and slower, but I'm extremely happy with the results.
The trim looks clean and professional, and the custom fit makes the doorway look like it belongs there instead of feeling like something jammed awkwardly into the corner.

Between the jamb and the trim, I spent **a lot** of time on this project.
It was stretched out over a month or more, so I lost track of how much time it was exactly, but it was definitely more than 20 hours and probably more than 30 hours.
I was moving slow in the first place since it was my first time doing a door jamb and trim from scratch and I was learning as I went.
All the unusual needs of the project added a bunch more time on top of that.
Still, I don't know that I regret all the hard work.
I could have simplified the project dramatically by compromising on some things, like the door swing and the trim fit, but I think the result would have felt very noticeably like a compromise.
I mostly enjoyed the work too, since I like creative problem solving and it's a little jolt of positive feedback every time you get something exactly right.

## The stair trim ##

Now that the door frame was finished, I was ready to install the quarter round, right?
Ha!
No.
I was not ready to install the quarter round.

The space between the door frame and the stairs is weird and small, so do I put the world's tiniest piece of quarter round?
Also, the end of the trim piece on the stairs had never really been finished, just cut flush and left.
If I wrapped the trim around the corner to meet the door trim, it would solve both problems at once.

This meant I needed to try to match the existing trim on the stairs.
Luckily, I have a father in law who is a woodworker and has lots of leftover bits of wood lying around.
He had just what I needed, a spare cutoff of 1"x12" red oak.
I used the table saw to slice a section to length, and then cut another triangular slice that would wrap around the corner at 45°.
I couldn't do a standard outside miter because the existing trim was cut flush with the wall, and doing it like a butt joint would have left end grain exposed.
Wrapping it like this solved that problem, plus given the prominent location, I think a square corner might have felt like a bit much.
This softens it up a bit.
As with the other trim, the goal here was to not call attention to this, and I feel like I succeeded.

I used the CA glue + activator trick to bond the angled piece to the rest of the trim.
It was hugely helpful to have that option, as the piece was so small and fiddly that any other option for securing it would have been fraught with peril and/or a huge nuisance.

With that trim in place, I did finally actually install the quarter round on the other side of the door frame.
What an accomplishment!
Of course, now that I had done all the work to prepare the frame for a door, I still needed a door.

## The door ##

Our house helpfully came with some spare doors, mostly those pulled off second-floor closets.
These were the right width for the bathroom door, so I picked one unlucky door to go under the knife.
I needed to remove a corner so it would fit in the frame.
I measured about eight times because I was nervous about screwing this up.

The event itself was over pretty quickly, just some very careful cutting with the circular saw.
I think I used painters' tape as an extra safeguard against splintering, but the door cut very cleanly and I had measured well.

To tighten up the arc a little more, I also chiseled out a little more of the hinge mortises on the door so it could sit further "in" on the hinge.
This may have been a mistake, because it turns out there's nothing more difficult than relocating a screw hole by 1/8".
The screws will be determined to find their way back to the old hole, and standard wood filler isn't strong enough to hold up to that.
