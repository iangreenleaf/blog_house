The router was an indispensable tool for making the frame, and it was an excellent skill builder for that tool.
I started by looking around online for inspiration, and was surprised to find fewer articles than I expected on medium-fancy routed frames.
[These ones]() weren't exactly what I had in mind, but at least were in the ballpark, and gave me some good ideas about what was doable and would look nice.
I took some scrap lumber to the router and started trying out ideas, refining as I went.
Since I hadn't done this before, I had to try a lot of things before I settled on a combination I liked (and could do with my on-hand selection of router bits).

Here's the profile I ended up with.

That little piece on top was cut from a separate length and glued on to add more height.
I'm not sure this is the best way to do it--that left a visible seam on the outside of the frame.
I was able to deal with that with a judicious cut-in, but it would probably be better not to have a visible join on the side at all.



The hardwood came in 8' lengths, which unfortunately was just a little too long to be able to feed through the router table in its current position on the workbench.
I could have moved it out to the driveway, but not that would have left me doing all the work while kneeling outside, and needing to haul eveything in and out for every work session (not ideal for work I broke up into about 5 small sessions over the course of a week).
Plus it was December, and working with the garage door shut and heat lamp on was a lot more pleasant than being totally exposed.
So I cut each length into two separate pieces I could route one at a time.
Worked fine, but it made me very nervous about the math, since I didn't have a ton of room to spare and lengths get tricky when you're dealing with miters and rabbets.



The miters gave me more trouble than I expected them to.
It was too bad, after spending so much time on the frame details, to have the result diminished a little but such a simple issue.
Part of the problem is my cheap miter saw.
A bevel cut would have been the easiest alignment to cut the pieces while easily keeping them flat and not dealing with too much tear-out.
Unfortunately the bevel adjustment stops at about 44Â°, even with the limit screw maxed out, ruling out that option.
Stuck with the regular miter adjustment, I tried cutting the pieces upside down to spare me some nasty tearout, but when I went to assemble them I discovered I had not successfully kept the pieces flat enough and the miters were now at wonky angles.
Cutting right side up was the only thing that was going to work, so I flipped them over and trimmed the ends down, dealing with the tear-out with tape and sanding, but by this point I was running out of time and getting a little rushed, so I didn't get them quite perfect and there's a few gaps.
Not a huge deal, they still look fine, but I know I could have done better.
I'm also going to prioritize building a miter sled for my new table saw, as I think that would have been a cleaner, faster, and more precise way to get these pieces cut.
