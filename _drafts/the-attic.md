The attic was one of the big unfinished projects we inherited with the house.
It appeared the previous owners had been aiming to convert it into a bedroom suite.
We weren't very excited about that plan (the layout seemed impractical), but we were excited to have the space available to use.
It adds square footage to the house, and since it's on a different floor, it offers some separation from other parts of the house if someone needs some alone time (the dog regularly needs her alone time).

Things that were finished when we got it:

 * The ceiling and walls were insulated with spray foam and drywalled.
 * There was a mostly-complete half bathroom.
 * A subfloor was installed.
 * There was a sweet skylight.

Things that were not finished:

 * There was no heating or cooling.
 * There was no floor on top of the subfloor.

Despite missing a few obvious things, the attic was basically usable.
You could walk on the subfloor, even if it wasn't all that nice, and the space got enough ambient heat from the rest of the house that it was a reasonable temperature most of the year.
So after moving in, we threw down a couple beater rugs, moved up a chair that didn't have another home, and proceeded to use the half-finished attic for an embarrassingly long time.

Eventually, though, it did rise to the top of our house priorities.
Having the space fully finished would make it much more pleasant and welcoming, which would encourage us to use it more often and make it a place we could bring guests (we did put one visitor on an air mattress on the subfloor, sorry Sean).
Also, we really needed to get a better floor surface down.
The subfloor conducted sound very clearly to the floor below, which especially becomes a problem when the dumb dog goes through a sleep regression and decides to spend the 1 AM hour pacing around the attic, clicking her nails on the floor directly above the room where you're trying to sleep.

## Radiator ##

If the attic was going to be a fully-functional space, it needed a heat source.
The insulation was doing its job well, and heat rising from the rest of the house kept the attic above 50℉ even in the winter, but it wasn't always comfortable.

Some lines had been plumbed from the radiator but they just terminated at the top of the chase without being hooked up to anything.
The small bathroom appeared to have tubing installed for hydronic in-floor heat.
I suspected the previous owners had been planning to put in-floor heat in the rest of the attic as well, so I looked into that option but wasn't crazy about it.
The typical method involves stapling tubing to the subfloor and then covering it with a layer of self-leveling gypcrete.
This would add about and inch and a half to the floor height, which would put the finished floor pretty high above the level of the stair transition and the bathroom floor, which seemed like an awkward nuisance to deal with.
Also, pouring gypcrete is super messy, not something I was particularly excited to have done on the top floor of our otherwise-finished house.
And having a big concrete slab introduces a whole bunch of extra weight and potential for moisture issues, complications I wasn't especially keen to introduce.

I spent a long time looking at [Warmboard](https://www.warmboard.com/warmboard-s) and a couple competing products, which skip the slab and embed the tubing in engineered panels instead.
These were very enticing, but not a perfect fit for our situation.
To avoid adding a bunch of height to the floor, we'd want to go with the version integrated into subfloor panels (rather than the retrofit version), which would mean tearing up all the existing subfloor and doing it over, which seemed kind of dumb.
With the attic's small floor plan, getting a sensible layout designed from the mix 'n' match panels looked like a challenge.
And while I didn't ever get a full quote on one of these systems, I gathered that they would be fairly expensive.

In the end, in-floor heat was just too great of an investment for what was essentially a bonus space.
Going to all this trouble might be worth the trouble for the long-term benefits in a heavily-used part of the house, but the attic simply wasn't important enough to warrant such a big effort and expense.
So I backed off the radiant heat idea and aimed for simpler, inexpensive heating options instead.

The rest of the house is heated by classic floor-standing radiators.
I wasn't excited about going that route in the attic because the sloped walls meant there weren't many places to tuck a radiator that would be out of the way, and with standing-room floor space at a premium I didn't want to sacrifice a bunch of it to a radiator.

Baseboard radiators would be another option.
Electric baseboard heaters have a bad reputation, but hydronic (i.e. powered by hot water from a boiler) versions are apparently pretty good.
They could nestle along the two long sides of the attic, where the walls slope.
They would be nice and out of the way and utilize wall space in areas that were too short for use anyhow.
The main sticking point with baseboards was that I wanted to have that wall space available for shelves so we could have some storage in the attic.
If those walls were dedicated to baseboard radiators, it would be much more difficult to have usable shelves there.

The option that we ended up going with was a wall-mounted radiator.
These are apparently very common in Europe, but still unusual here.
I don't know why—they work well, have a small footprint, and are attractive.
Of course, our lack of vertical walls up there presented a challenge, but we had one good wall by the bathroom door that seemed like a good candidate.
It was also located right next to the chase where the existing plumbing had been run, which meant installation wouldn't require running a bunch of new pipe.
A backup option would be to get a radiator short enough to install on one of the knee walls (wall-mounted radiators come in a variety of different dimensions).

I talked to a couple contractors who worked with wall-mounted radiators.
They worked out the heating needs for the space and gave me some options of radiator sizes that would produce enough heat.
One of those sizes was a TODO, which would fit nicely on the available wall.
We went with [Stafford](https://www.staffordhomeservice.com/) again, the same folks who had finished our [air conditioning]({% post_url 2021-05-03-air-conditioning %}).

The first install date, it turned out they had ordered the TODO size instead of the TODO size, which wasn't going to fit our space (and no, you can't just turn it sideways, I agree that would be the most convenient solution).
So we had to wait a while longer while the correct one was special-ordered from Europe, because there aren't distributors state-side.

The install itself went smoothly.
Jeremy, my favorite foreman, was back for this job.
He and I spent a while dialing in the exact placement of the fixture.
At issue was how to position it so it wouldn't obstruct the swing of the bathroom door.
I hadn't figured out yet which way the door would be hinged, and it's a complicated corner, so we went back and forth trying to visualize where the swing would go to make sure the radiator wouldn't obstruct it.

I'm pleased with the result.
The radiator is very low-profile, as desired.
It doesn't feel like it imposes on the space at all, and as a bonus it looks pretty nice too.
It seems to have plenty of heating power for the space.
We had some problems after installation with air getting into the system, but Jeremy came back out to deal with it.
I was pretty convinced (based on past experience) that the issue was that the water pressure in the system wasn't high enough for the third floor.
Jeremy was less convinced, but after bumping up the water pressure the issues resolved themselves, so I'm calling it a win for me.

## Knee walls ##

When we first moved in, the attic's sloped ceiling (a 45° angle) continued uninterrupted until it met the floor.
A counter-intuitive result: while this arrangement technically maximizes the floor space and room volume, it made the room *feel* smaller.
My theory is that because the area nearest the floor is so cramped and unusable, the brain picks up on that and labels the room in general as cramped.

Early on, someone had suggested "knee walls", short walls around the perimeter that enclose the smallest part of the room's edge.
As we used the space and noticed the psychological effect of the weird corners, we started to see the wisdom of that suggestion.
Once the air conditioning system was installed, knee walls became a requirement because there were ducts running along the edges of the room that needed to be hidden and protected.

This was something I probably could have done myself, but I didn't really want to.
I had very little experience with either framing or drywall, and since this was a significantly more complicated situation that your basic interior wall, it didn't seem like the right project to learn on.
Plus I was very short on time and was never going to finish the attic without some help.

Our neighbor Jim did construction and had worked on several houses in the neighborhood, including ours under the previous owner.
We decided this seemed like a good project to bring him in on.
He and his business partner got most of the job done in a couple days, plus a couple follow-ups for drywall sanding.

The knee walls have a big positive impact on the ambience.
It now feels like a room, rather than like a weird tent.
My only gripe with the installation is that the line of the knee walls isn't perfectly square with the rest of the room.
Maybe this is too much to expect from a retrofit in an old house that isn't perfectly square to being with, but it did make my life a fair bit more difficult during the floor installation.

## Floor ##

We had heat, we had walls, but there was still one important component missing: a floor.
In addition to being a basic utilitarian need, the floor had a central role to play in the attic.
Due to the short ceilings and the kid/dog-centric nature of the space, we anticipated that a lot of time would be spent directly on the attic floor.
We needed to figure out how to make it comfortable and durable to support that use case.

### Choices, choices ###

Most of our house is hardwood floors, which we love.
They add warmth and character and will last almost forever with some periodic maintenance.
The purist approach would have been to install matching hardwood in the attic.
However, the theme of the attic was [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing).
Hardwood would have added significantly to both the cost of materials and the cost of installation, so we didn't need to insist upon it if there were other options that would be almost as good for much less.
We had also already decided on a bold and quirky aesthetic for the attic, so it wasn't important that the materials perfectly matched the rest of the house, as long as they harmonized with it.
With this in mind, I investigated a variety of alternative flooring options.

I was intrigued by the idea of carpet tile.
They are easy to DIY install, and being able to replace single squares when they are worn or damaged seems like a big win for long-term maintenance.
Unfortunately, most carpet squares on the market are aimed at commercial spaces, so they come in a poor variety of bland colors, and they are very thin and not comfortable for sitting.
The only major carpet tile brand aimed at consumers, [Flor](https://www.flor.com/), is very stylish but is priced completely unreasonably.

I briefly and unenthusiastically looked into wall-to-wall carpeting.
Some preliminary research suggested that modern wall-to-wall still faces the same downsides that have soured people on it in the past: it holds on to dirt, it wears out and starts to look bad, and when you need to address a problem you have to completely tear it out and start over.

Engineered wood is an interesting compromise with some of the benefits of both hardwood and composite flooring.
If we were looking to do a bigger and more heavily-used space but weren't prepared to commit to hardwood, I'd probably take a closer look at engineered wood.
The cost savings didn't appear to be huge, though, so I kept looking.

Laminate flooring is what I finally settled on.
Laminate has come a long way from the cheap stuff that earned a not-so-stellar reputation in the past.
High-end laminate comes in some nice-looking finishes, is thick enough to feel nice underfoot and deaden sound, and offers guaranteed water resistance as long as spills are cleaned up within 24 hours.
It still has some limitations: it can't be refinished or repaired (other than by replacing boards), it probably won't last forever, and while fairly attractive it's still clear on close inspection that it's not real wood.
Because we were satisficing, we were fine with these tradeoffs.
Laminate would provide significant cost savings, and could be DIY installed relatively easily.
These were big perks, since we were trying not to sink too much money into this space and had already spent significantly on the other parts.

We looked around a bit to compare brands and color options.
Home Depot offers free samples to take home, which is convenient.
Their [Pergo Outlast+](https://na.pergo.com/laminate/collections/outlast) line seems like one of the more trusted brands in laminate, and we probably would have gone with that had we not been wooed away by… Costco!
Costco has since changed their offerings, but at the time they offered an in-house branded line of TODO flooring in a few different colors.
These come in the same thickness and with the same guarantees as the premium brands like Pergo.
Better yet, it periodically goes on sale from the already-low base price.
One of the colors was "Toasted Cinnamon", which went nicely with our planned paint colors and the attic in general.
Costco doesn't have samples, so I bought a single box of planks to bring home, we confirmed we liked the look, and then we waited for it to go on sale.
Then I drove to Costco and bought a trunk's worth of boxes.
The Costco cashiers, bless their hearts, don't even bat an eye when you roll up to checkout with a dolly of flooring almost too heavy to push and also a bag of pita chips.

TODO pic

In the end we got it for the ridiculously low price of TODO per square foot.
My only complaint with this line is that they gouge you on the accessories.
A piece of threshold to cover the transitions to the bathroom and staircase was (TODO?) $60.
The matching quarter round for the edges was also overpriced, especially for MDF.
Still, all minor gripes worth dealing with considering we paid TODO in materials, compared to TODO that we would have paid for brand-name.

### Tools needed ###

Installing laminate flooring isn't too demanding in terms of tools.
You need a couple simple specialized tools that can be bought as a kit.
The kits include a tap block to hammer planks into place without damaging the shaped edges, an offset metal piece to hammer in the final piece in a run when it reaches all the way to the wall, and spacers to maintain the proper gap between the flooring and the wall to allow for expansion and contraction.
We paid for the special installation kit sold by the manufacturer, but we would have been better off buying a generic kit from Home Depot—the spacers in the kit don't even match the factory-recommended spacing!

You'll need a caulk gun to seal the edges, and a nailer if you're attaching trim.
I bought a pair of kneepads, which were not necessary but nice given how much time is spent crawling around on the ground.
Fun story: my hamstrings were extremely sore after the weekend of the install.
Turns out I wasn't physically ready for that much crawling and kneeling.

The other big thing you need is a way to cut planks to size.
I think you could theoretically do all of this with a jigsaw if you wanted to keep the tool requirements to a minimum.
If I were going that route I'd just make sure I had a cutting station set up with some clamps and guides to make cuts reasonably fast and accurate.

Most of the cuts you'll make will be cross cuts, which are cuts across the short dimension of the plank.
You'll need to do this to cut the plank to size at the end of every row, and also at the beginning of most rows (you need to start rows with differing lengths so that the joints are staggered).
A miter saw was a big help here for speed and ease of cutting.
I had a cheap Menards store brand miter saw I bought off a neighbor.
It was a sliding saw and had just enough clearance to fit the ~8" planks we were using—well, sort of.
With the saw slid all the way out, there was only one orientation of the planks where the tongue sat low enough for the teeth of the blade to clear it while starting up, so I had to flip each board to get it lined up for a cut, which was sometimes highly inconvenient.
If only it were a "chop" where the blade could raise and lower, I wouldn't have the clearance problems.
Well, some two years after finishing the attic, I was fiddling with the saw doing some maintenance and discovered a knob that hadn't seemed to move on first inspection but with some persuading did unfreeze and release a mechanism… what do you know, I had a chop saw the whole time.
I guess "know how to operate your tools" is the lesson here.

Unless you're exceedingly lucky, the other cuts you'll need to make are rip cuts, which are cuts along the long dimension of the plank.
These are necessary anywhere the long edge of the planks meet a wall that doesn't line up with the full width of the planks.
Try to plan your floor to a) minimize the amount of wall requiring these cuts and b) not create too narrow a section of plank at any wall.
The runs that were just an inch or two wide were unpleasant to install and it was difficult to convince the narrow bits of plank to lie flat.
I had a table saw that I could have used for these cuts, but since our knee walls were slightly out of square, most of the sections we needed were actually tapered by about an inch over the length of the plank.
I didn't have a taper jig for the table saw, so I ended up using a circular saw with a piece of sacrificial plywood underneath.

The good news is that all of your cut edges will be in places that get covered by trim, so you don't need to get absolutely clean or perfect cuts.
Just get it close enough and don't damage the rest of the piece.

### Installation ###

Laminate is installed as "floating" floor, meaning it's not nailed or glued to the subfloor but is a separate layer that can expand and contract independently with changes in temperature or humidity.
To accommodate this movement, you leave a small gap between the edges of the floor and the walls, and hide it with quarter round trim on the walls.
You also put a thin layer of foam "underlayment" between the floor and subfloor to allow movement and help deaden sound, but our flooring came with that pre-attached, which saved us an extra step.
The planks have a sort of locking tongue and groove thing on the edges that hold them tightly together once attached.
You either slide the plank in at an angle and lever it flat to lock in place, or if you don't have room to do that, you just take a hammer and sorta bang it into place (this is where you need the tools from your installation kit).

After a bit of experimenting, Katherine and I were able to get into a good working rhythm.
For the long runs of open space, she would get 2-3 planks lined up and attached end-to-end while I looked ahead and lined up the next planks to be used.
I would lay out planks in place to visually inspect them, since laminate has patterns that repeat and it looks a little funny if you put two identical patterns too close to each other.
Once Katherine had a run ready, we'd both lift it and snap it into place, and I would use the tap block to get it snugged up while she moved down to start on the next step.
For the edges and smaller spaces where we needed to cut pieces to fit, Katherine would attach one piece at a time while I measured or took planks away to cut them to size.

Cutting was definitely the bottleneck of our workflow.
We didn't have enough room in the attic itself to maneuver saws (and dust control would have been a big problem), so we moved the miter saw to the second-floor hallway for relatively easy access.
Rip cuts had to happen out in the garage, which was inconvenient, especially since I could often only measure one or two pieces at a time before trekking out to cut them and back to install them and continue the row.
The other tricky thing about the cuts is that each plank has two different connector shapes on the side, so you have to make sure your plank is in the right orientation when you plan the cut so it can snap in to the adjoining plank.
This also means that you can typically get two usable cut pieces out of each plank, but you have to pay attention to which ends they have, since they will fit at opposite ends of the room.

A hot tip I wish I had known: leave a fair number of spacers in the finished areas as you work on the rest of the room.
We took some spacers out too early, and then the forces from us installing adjacent rows shifted the flooring in a couple places to be too tight to the edges, which we only discovered well after the fact, once many additional rows had been added.
Fixing this took a lot of exertion trying to hammer them back into position, and in one case, some thankless sawing with an oscillating multi-tool.
The installation kit came with a limited number of spacers but they were kind of crappy and annoying to use.
At the end of the day, the best spacers were just cutoff ends of the planks themselves.
With the foam underlayment ripped off, I could set these vertically and they were close to the recommended spacing and easy to keep in place.

### Trim ###

Once the flooring is in, you are left with a small gap around the edges of the room.
For the waterproof guarantee to be valid, this gap needs to be sealed with silicone caulk.
Based on the manufacturer's suggestion, I got a big box of backer rod, which is a thin foam tube that you stuff into the gap to fill up some of the space before sealing with caulk.
The backer rod isn't strictly necessary, it just saves money on caulk.
Luckily, the caulking job also doesn't need to be perfect as it will also be covered by trim.

Because of our short knee walls, we weren't planning on doing baseboards around most of the attic.
Given that, it felt like it would make sense to trim the edges with quarter round matched to the floor color so that it wouldn't stand out.
The manufacturer sold matching quarter round, but it had to be special ordered, and the pricing was pretty unreasonable, especially since it was veneered MDF.
I decided to take a sample of the floor to Home Depot to see if I could find a good match there instead.
None of their MDF options looked particularly good, but for less than the manufacturer's MDF I could buy proper hardwood quarter round, pre-stained.

The "TODO" color looked pretty close, so I bought a single piece to take home and try in the attic to make sure it still looked like a match in natural lighting conditions.
It looked great, but I was about to learn an important lesson: when buying from Home Depot, buy everything you need at once so it comes from the same lot, and just overbuy and return the excess when you're done.
When I sent Katherine to a different Home Depot to pick up the amount we needed, she returned with some quarter round that was still labeled "TODO" but was a dramatically different shade, enough that it was no longer a good match to the floor.
Then I proceeded to try multiple Home Depots that didn't have enough in stock.
It was also listed under a different name on their website, so I didn't figure out right away how to check ahead for stock levels—not that those listings are correct more than half the time anyways.
I finally succeeded at some far-flung suburban Home Depot where the shelves were almost empty but I found a dolly nearby loaded with bundles of trim, including the color I needed.
I spent about 15 minutes asking a chain of employees until I found the one who could confirm that yes, that dolly was stuff waiting to be restocked, and yes, I could go ahead and take what I needed off it.
Another Home Depot lesson: never involve anyone else if you can help it.
Just ninja the stuff into your cart, head for the checkout, and assume it will be fine.

My final folly was thinking I would hand-nail the trim with finish nails and a nail punch instead of using a pneumatic air nailer.
I was biased against air nailers because I had just spent a bunch of time trying to fix the extremely sloppy job someone had done on our second-floor trim, where some of the air nailer brads hadn't fully driven in all the way and they had just bent them flat instead of actually doing a decent job of anything.
So I figured I would do a better job by hand, and wouldn't need to find a nail gun and compressor, and if it took me a little extra time that was okay.

It only took one test piece to determine that I was mistaken.
Driving finish nails through the hardwood trim was physically difficult, especially doing so while trying to hold the trim piece in place without letting it slip.
Using the nail punch took some practice not to mar the wood.
And after all that, the finish nails left a much more noticeable hole in the wood than a small brad.
I accepted that I was wrong and I would deeply regret trying to do this all by hand.
Serendipitously, in the time it took me to figure this out, my father-in-law had showed up with a small compressor and nail gun from his father's estate.
So I didn't have to try very hard to acquire the tools after all, and I just did it with an air nailer and it was much easier and looks great.

The hardest part was cutting miters on some of the non-90° angles, so allow me to brag for a moment about my beautiful miters:

TODO

Admittedly there are a couple that don't look as nice because I was a hair off on the length, or a degree off on one of the non-square walls.
But they all came out more than passable, and the style choices worked very well in the room.

TODO paint, etc? Split this into two posts?
