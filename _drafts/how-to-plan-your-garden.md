title: How to plan your garden

Part of the planning process was turning the dreams I had floating around in my head into concrete goals.
 * A large garden plot dedicated to food production
 * Fruit trees and berry bushes
 * Food and habitat for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife
 * As much of a fully-functioning natural ecosystem as possible
 * Features to draw charismatic wildlife such as hummingbirds and butterflies
 * Beauty in all four seasons, both for our enjoyment and for passersby
 * Areas for relaxing outside
 * Flexible space for gatherings, activities, dog and child playtime, etc
 * Low maintenance burden
 * A rain garden, probably
 * Lilac bushes (they're my favorite flower)

We also had some site-specific constraints and issues to address.
Most of these were revealed during the observation period.

 * Our north-facing windows are close to the street, and with only empty space between the house and the sidewalk, it made our dining room feel a little exposed.
   It would be nice to have something to partially screen the view.
 * Since the yard is level with the public sidewalk, it feels very weird if there isn't something to delineate the border.
 * The wind can really rip across parts of the lot.
   The worst seems to be north winds traveling across the front yard.
 * The back of the lot, near the alley, was neglected and in terrible condition.
   The soil was so compacted that nothing would grow there until it was improved.
   Drainage was also very poor and it would remain very wet for a long time after rains.
 * The alley is not a charming view and would do well to be screened.
 * The thin strip between the garage and alley was full of weeds and in bad condition, being an especially tough site.
 * Much of the lawn was lumpy and uneven.
   Some areas had pretty good grass, but others were very weedy and/or patchy.

## Zones ##

One common permaculture planning tool is ["zones"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Zones).
Zones are a framework for thinking about how location affects the manner and frequency of our interactions with a space, and planning our land use to be compatible with these factors.
Things that we use often, or that require frequent attention, should be located in areas that are easy to access and that we frequently visit.
Areas that are further from the house or harder to access will be visited less often, and are harder to supply with resources like water or compost.
We should use these areas for things that require fewer inputs and can take care of themselves without frequent weeding or other maintenance.

The canonical 5-zone framework is oriented towards larger tracts of land, like rural homesteads, and so many of the specifics are not as relevant to urban lots.
An urban lot is unlikely to have zones 3 through 5 (farming, forage, and wilderness) located within its boundaries.
However, the general concepts are still a useful tool for planning an urban space.
Our yard very much has areas that are easier or harder to access, and visited more or less frequently.

The "back nine", for example, is far enough from the house that most hoses don't reach.
We also don't pass through that area on the way to or from anywhere else, and we don't spend time in that area to relax or work.
When planning what to do with it, I knew it should contain things that were resilient and largely self-sufficient.
While that area was a potential site for the vegetable garden in terms of size and sun, I knew that was something that should go in a closer "zone" if possible.

The strip between the alley and garage is even further out, zone-wise.
Not only is it far from the house, it's completely out of sight from almost everywhere in the house and yard.
Out of sight, out of mind!
Therefore, my top criteria for any use of that site was that it had to succeed under severe neglect.

The closest zone in our lot is probably the area right outside the back door.
This is very close to the kitchen, and we pass through multiple times per day on the way to the garage, driveway, or out for walks.
This would be an ideal site for herbs and other plants that need frequent access or attention, but unfortunately this area is also heavily shaded by the white pines, so most options would not do well there.
I would compromise on these things and put them in a location that wasn't quite as frequently visited but provided much better growing conditions.
Zones aren't the final word, but rather a useful tool to be used as part of a toolkit.

## Sectors ##

Another planning tool described in _Edible Forest Gardens_ is ["sectors"](https://open.oregonstate.education/permaculture/chapter/sectors/).
