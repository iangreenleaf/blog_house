You'll want to know a couple things about your site before you start looking at plants, as these will narrow down the plants that are available to you, and may also affect where and how you grow some things.

First is what hardiness zone you are in, which is essentially a descriptor of how cold your winters get and thus what plants will survive outside.
The [interactive map from USDA](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx) is the best place to find yours.
Of note: the USDA redid the maps in 2012 but some resources are still using the older maps from 1990, so watch your sources.
The 2012 maps are more detailed and are likely a better bet for our changing climate.

If you live in the Western US, you might want to check out some alternative climate classifications that are more relevant to some of the peculiarities of arid mountain or Pacific coast climates, but here in the Midwest the USDA zones work pretty well.
Hardiness zones aren't the final word on which plants will do well, but they're a good place to start and almost every perennial plant source will include zone information in their listings, so it's a good point of reference.
While most of our swath of MN is zone 4b, we're actually in a tiny pocket of 5a on the detailed map.
The pocket is centered around the airport, but I suspect that really most of the Twin Cities is probably 5a thanks to the urban heat island, and that the way it's mapped is something to do with averaging and that the official source of climate data near us is the airport weather station.
So when I'm selecting plants, I mostly look for zone 4 plants as those are the sure bet to do well here, but I will consider zone 5 plants if they are highly desirable, especially if they will be in a sheltered location or otherwise have some additional cold protection.

The second thing to know is the pH of your soil.
If you're somewhere around neutral pH, most plants will grow fine and you don't need to worry much.
If you're far in either direction, you might need to consider amending your soil, or being more careful about your plant selection to make sure you get things that will like the conditions.
You can buy inexpensive handheld soil testing kits that seem to get okay results when used properly.https://rootedrevival.com/soil-drainage-test/
If you have an extension office that does soil testing, you can get a much more accurate test from them, as well as a report on levels of other important soil elements.
I took samples from a couple different areas of our yard and dropped them off at the [UMN Soil Lab](http://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/).
Our soil is ever so slightly alkaline, so I expect most things to grow well except for a few acid-loving plants (like blueberries).

I also ordered a lead test from the soil lab, since urban soils often have lead contamination, a legacy of the [absurdly long time we spent putting leaded gasoline in cars](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-most-important-scientist-you-ve-never-heard-of).
Our yard has some lead contamination, though well under the levels considered "safe".
I did my research and decided that I did not need to take any drastic measures to deal with this.
Amending soil with organic material, which I was planning to do anyways, is one of the best ways to render lead harmless.
I should prevent children from eating our soil in large quantities, but other than that it's unlikely to present a threat.

The third thing to know is the composition of your soil.
Soil is typically some combination of sand, loam, and clay.
Too much sand or too much clay can be a problem, primarily because it will lead to water draining too quickly or two slowly.
There are a few simple tests you can do to assess your soil composition.
I think a simple [drainage test](https://rootedrevival.com/soil-drainage-test/) is probably the best bang for your buck.
