I was relatively sure I knew what we needed.
The structural parts of the chimney were all there, we just needed to cover it with something that provided permanent weatherproofing and looked like an actual finished product.
Apparently it's common to put siding on these types of chimneys (because the outer structure doesn't actually experience much heat), but I was never convinced that we could pull that off in a way that was anything but ugly.
The chimney is quite tall, presumably because it needs to extend beyond the second floor, and it comes directly out of the roof so it doesn't have any visual connection to the rest of the siding.

Finding someone to actually do the job proved much more difficult.
Chimney companies told me I should find a mason.
Masons told me they didn't do veneers.
Contractors told me I should put siding on it.
Siding companies told me they only did full-house jobs.
The city inspector told me I needed to have it inspected because he didn't think it was to code (it was).
The overall hassle of just finding someone who wanted to do the job felt very disproportionate to the actual size of the job. Welcome to home ownership, I guess.

After not seeing much success through other routes, I decided to give [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/) a try and it worked out well for me (they have since changed their business model so I wouldn't necessarily vouch for them any more).
We got matched up with several worthwhile contractors, including the one we went with, Ryan at [Creative Concepts](http://www.creativeconceptsconcrete.com/).
Ryan not only had the best quoting process and communication, his bid came in well under all the others, so it ended up being an easy decision.
I suspect Ryan may have underbid the job and regretted it later, but if that was the case he was a total professional about it and never turned it into my problem.
He and his crew did great work and (as far as my untrained eyes can tell) the results are excellent.

I lined the job up to be part of our spring of construction, hoping that we could get the chimney folks done and out of the way before the fence folks started.
It worked out in the end, though it wasn't quite as simple as any of us hoped.
The installation was, in theory, a pretty straightforward affair.
Erect scaffolding, check the existing structure and put up metal lathing.
Have an inspector check it, then spend a couple days brick & mortaring and we'd be all done.
Unfortunately, winter decided to perform a Minnesota goodbye that year.
The poor crew had a snowstorm roll in halfway through their work, and the temperature dropped enough that they couldn't keep putting up mortar because it wouldn't cure properly.
So work got suspended for nearly a week while April refused to actually act like spring.
Ryan was very communicative and kept apologizing for the delays, which I appreciated, but it's not like I expected him to be able control the weather.
These things happen!
These delays would have messed up scheduling with the other contractors, but the cold was causing delays for everything else too, so it worked out okay.
