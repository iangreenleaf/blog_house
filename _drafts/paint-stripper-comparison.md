Jasco: A little runny and harder to get good thick coverage. Starts working crazy fast.

Max Strip: Supper runny, and useless.

Klean Strip: Pretty good consistency, but ran a little more than the others over time.

Citristrip, Peel Away, Smart Strip and Smart Strip Plus all had good consistency.

Smart Strip: $59/gallon from paint store.
