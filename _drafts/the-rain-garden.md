## Resources ##

The best resource I found for rain garden design and installation was [this guide from Blue Thumb]().
It offers a lot of useful information, including a lot of very specific practical advice that is invaluable if you're going to be doing the installation yourself.

TODO plant lists

The other good way to determine this for specific plants is [Prairie Moon's excellent plant information](https://www.prairiemoon.com/).
They list moisture preferences for each plant, which is a good approximation of where they'd like to be in a rain garden.
Plants listed as "wet" and "medium-wet" will likely be happy in the bottom of the basin.
"Dry" or "medium-dry" plants need to be fully outside of the basin.
Plants in the medium zone will probably be happy on the sides of the basin.

## Plant selection ##

The plant selection for the rain garden and immediate surroundings is entirely species that are native to Minnesota.
I didn't set out with that as the goal—some people adhere to a very strict natives-only policy just for purity's sake, but that never particularly called to me.
It just turned out that native plants provided the best functional fit for my goals in this space.

Native plants are a very good bet to do well in our climate because they literally evolved to grow here.
They provide the highest-quality food and habitat for native insects because those insects evolved in parallel to depend on these plants.
Many native plants need very little maintenance, and once established, they can outcompete weeds.
Native plants often have very deep root systems that help with water infiltration and allow them to tolerate major dry spells without supplemental watering.
There is also a very good selection of native plants that will tolerate alternating wet and dry conditions, perfect for planting inside the basin of the rain garden, which may be underwater for some hours after a heavy rain but also may dry out completely after several weeks of no rain.

As I evaluated candidates for planting in this area, native plants kept rising to the top of the list because they had so much to offer.
Many plants exist that could fill the space and look nice, but with those traits being equal, why would I not choose the option that comes with so many additional benefits?
The common downsides of natives (that they take a while to get established and that they don't always lend themselves to a carefully manicured garden aesthetic) were also not concerns for me, and I have access to several vendors of high-quality and ethically-sourced native plant seedlings, so there wasn't much reason for me to say no.

Once I had settled on about 90% of the plant selection and it was all natives, it seemed like I might as well lean into it and declare the area 100% natives, so that's what I did.
Everything between the existing non-native blue spruce to the west and the non-native peach tree I planted to the east is, to the best of my knowledge, a plant native to Minnesota.
The only sections that were a little trickier to design with this constraint were the low groundcovers (along the path and the fenceline) and the areas of full shade (particularly in the house's shadow and underneath the spruce).
Native plants for these conditions do exist, but it took a bit more research to uncover good candidates and sometimes took more effort to source seedlings than it did for more common plants in the other areas.
Still, I'm glad I decided to set myself the challenge.
It's been fun to puzzle out how to get everything I want within the palette of native plants, and it has kept the design for this area nice and focused.

## Design ##

Goals for plants in this area:

* Aid infiltration of runoff
* Provide [food, shelter, water, and habitat](https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/) to a variety of wildlife
* Partially screen the view from the sidewalk into the dining room
* Provide beautiful views from the two sets of windows
* Flowers blooming throughout the entire growing season, so people and pollinators will always have something to enjoy
* Lots of different colors, because colors are pretty
* Require few to no inputs (water, mulch, fertilizer) once established
* Require little weeding and other maintenance once established

Placing trees and shrubs along the north edge seemed like a good plan, so I started there.
These could provide a screen and beautiful views, and putting them on the north side would leave plenty of sunny space for other plants.
I came up with a short list by consulting lists of native woody plants that enjoy a fair amount of moisture, cross referenced with lists of plants that provide benefits to birds and pollinators.
Then I sketched a ton of different layouts, evaluating each one for how well it provided screening and views, and if it left room for a good rainwater basin and lots of sun for wildflowers.

I settled on a large serviceberry shrub/tree and a couple medium shrubs, highbush cranberry and chokeberry.
All three of these have attractive flowers, nice fall color, and berries that are popular with birds and (to varying degrees) edible for humans as well.
Elderberry almost made the cut, but we had acquired a dog who likes to eat a lot of things she finds outside, and there are some reports of elderberry toxicity to pets—not a particularly grave danger, but I decided I'd be happier if I just didn't have to worry about how many unripe berries the dog had eaten off a bush in one sitting.

The rule of thumb for siting rain gardens is they should be at least 10 feet away from the foundation.
That plus the placement of the woody plants defined the approximate shape of the basin.
I made sure to extend it far enough to provide channels to both of the downspouts that would be feeding it.

The final step was filling it in with wildflowers and native grasses.
Starting with the list of candidates I had built up from my resources, I started slotting them in based on sun an moisture preferences and plant height.
Advice for designing with native plants is to plant them in "drifts" of multiples for the best visual effect, so I did mostly groups of 3-4 per species.

My rain garden plan called for a *lot* of different species.
In no way was this necessary; you can make a perfectly beautiful and functional rain garden with a much smaller palette.
But I had gotten really excited about native plants during all my research and wanted to fit in as many as I could.
One of the advantages of all that variety was that I didn't have to plan too carefully around bloom times.
With all the different flowers, there are always a few things blooming at any given time, giving pollinators a nice steady supply of food.

After a first draft to rough things in, I did a second draft of the plan with colored pencils to mark flower colors.
This helped me fine-tune the placements so I could have a nice mix of colors throughout the space and not have all the yellows clumped together or anything like that.
Plus, this made my plan look really fancy like I knew what I was doing.

Hot tip: don't forget the grasses.
They're not as showy as the flowers, but they're pretty too and will add to the overall effect.
Plus, they're a crucial part of the prairie ecosystem, so if you want your prairie flowers to be happy, let them hang out with their grass buds.
I planned some grasses but not as many as I should have, in part because I didn't take my own advice, and in part because it was harder to source a variety of grasses than it was to source wildflowers.
In particular, grasses and sedges that like wet feet are not as readily available, so the basin was a little lacking in grass.
In the years following I've started some additional grasses and sedges from seed to help fill in.
