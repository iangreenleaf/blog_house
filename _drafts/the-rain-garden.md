## Resources ##

The best resource I found for rain garden design and installation was [this guide from Blue Thumb]().
It offers a lot of useful information, including a lot of very specific practical advice that is invaluable if you're going to be doing the installation yourself.

TODO plant lists

The other good way to determine this for specific plants is [Prairie Moon's excellent plant information](https://www.prairiemoon.com/).
They list moisture preferences for each plant, which is a good approximation of where they'd like to be in a rain garden.
Plants listed as "wet" and "medium-wet" will likely be happy in the bottom of the basin.
"Dry" or "medium-dry" plants need to be fully outside of the basin.
Plants in the medium zone will probably be happy on the sides of the basin.

## Plant selection ##

The plant selection for the rain garden and immediate surroundings is entirely species that are native to Minnesota.
I didn't set out with that as the goal—some people adhere to a very strict natives-only policy just for purity's sake, but that never particularly called to me.
It just turned out that native plants provided the best functional fit for my goals in this space.

Native plants are a very good bet to do well in our climate because they literally evolved to grow here.
They provide the highest-quality food and habitat for native insects because those insects evolved in parallel to depend on these plants.
Many native plants need very little maintenance, and once established, they can outcompete weeds.
Native plants often have very deep root systems that help with water infiltration and allow them to tolerate major dry spells without supplemental watering.
There is also a very good selection of native plants that will tolerate alternating wet and dry conditions, perfect for planting inside the basin of the rain garden, which may be underwater for some hours after a heavy rain but also may dry out completely after several weeks of no rain.

As I evaluated candidates for planting in this area, native plants kept rising to the top of the list because they had so much to offer.
Many plants exist that could fill the space and look nice, but with those traits being equal, why would I not choose the option that comes with so many additional benefits?
The common downsides of natives (that they take a while to get established and that they don't always lend themselves to a carefully manicured garden aesthetic) were also not concerns for me, and I have access to several vendors of high-quality and ethically-sourced native plant seedlings, so there wasn't much reason for me to say no.

Once I had settled on about 90% of the plant selection and it was all natives, it seemed like I might as well lean into it and declare the area 100% natives, so that's what I did.
Everything between the existing non-native blue spruce to the west and the non-native peach tree I planted to the east is, to the best of my knowledge, a plant native to Minnesota.
The only sections that were a little trickier to design with this constraint were the low groundcovers (along the path and the fenceline) and the areas of full shade (particularly in the house's shadow and underneath the spruce).
Native plants for these conditions do exist, but it took a bit more research to uncover good candidates and sometimes took more effort to source seedlings than it did for more common plants in the other areas.
Still, I'm glad I decided to set myself the challenge.
It's been fun to puzzle out how to get everything I want within the palette of native plants, and it has kept the design for this area nice and focused.

## Design ##

Goals for plants in this area:

* Aid infiltration of runoff
* Provide [food, shelter, water, and habitat](https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/) to a variety of wildlife
* Partially screen the view from the sidewalk into the dining room
* Provide beautiful views from the two sets of windows
* Flowers blooming throughout the entire growing season, so people and pollinators will always have something to enjoy
* Lots of different colors, because colors are pretty
* Require few to no inputs (water, mulch, fertilizer) once established
* Require little weeding and other maintenance once established

Placing trees and shrubs along the north edge seemed like a good plan, so I started there.
These could provide a screen and beautiful views, and putting them on the north side would leave plenty of sunny space for other plants.
I came up with a short list by consulting lists of native woody plants that enjoy a fair amount of moisture, cross referenced with lists of plants that provide benefits to birds and pollinators.
Then I sketched a ton of different layouts, evaluating each one for how well it provided screening and views, and if it left room for a good rainwater basin and lots of sun for wildflowers.

I settled on a large serviceberry shrub/tree and a couple medium shrubs, highbush cranberry and chokeberry.
All three of these have attractive flowers, nice fall color, and berries that are popular with birds and (to varying degrees) edible for humans as well.
Elderberry almost made the cut, but we had acquired a dog who likes to eat a lot of things she finds outside, and there are some reports of elderberry toxicity to pets—not a particularly grave danger, but I decided I'd be happier if I just didn't have to worry about how many unripe berries the dog had eaten off a bush in one sitting.

The rule of thumb for siting rain gardens is they should be at least 10 feet away from the foundation.
That plus the placement of the woody plants defined the approximate shape of the basin.
I made sure to extend it far enough to provide channels to both of the downspouts that would be feeding it.

The final step was filling it in with wildflowers and native grasses.
Starting with the list of candidates I had built up from my resources, I started slotting them in based on sun an moisture preferences and plant height.
Advice for designing with native plants is to plant them in "drifts" of multiples for the best visual effect, so I did mostly groups of 3-4 per species.

My rain garden plan called for a *lot* of different species.
In no way was this necessary; you can make a perfectly beautiful and functional rain garden with a much smaller palette.
But I had gotten really excited about native plants during all my research and wanted to fit in as many as I could.
One of the advantages of all that variety was that I didn't have to plan too carefully around bloom times.
With all the different flowers, there are always a few things blooming at any given time, giving pollinators a nice steady supply of food.

After a first draft to rough things in, I did a second draft of the plan with colored pencils to mark flower colors.
This helped me fine-tune the placements so I could have a nice mix of colors throughout the space and not have all the yellows clumped together or anything like that.
Plus, this made my plan look really fancy like I knew what I was doing.

Hot tip: don't forget the grasses.
They're not as showy as the flowers, but they're pretty too and will add to the overall effect.
Plus, they're a crucial part of the prairie ecosystem, so if you want your prairie flowers to be happy, let them hang out with their grass buds.
I planned some grasses but not as many as I should have, in part because I didn't take my own advice, and in part because it was harder to source a variety of grasses than it was to source wildflowers.
In particular, grasses and sedges that like wet feet are not as readily available, so the basin was a little lacking in grass.
In the years following I've started some additional grasses and sedges from seed to help fill in.

## Installation ##

The rain garden was going in right by [the egress window]({% post_url 2020-11-12-basement-egress %}), so it definitely needed to wait until that was finished.
Luckily the window got done early in spring, so we were ready to get started on the garden as soon as the ground thawed, which ended up not happening until late April thanks to an endless winter.
I transferred the paper plan to the actual site by outlining the basin with marking paint and sticking stakes in the ground to mark the trees and shrubs.
This gave me a chance to fine-tune the design and make sure it harmonized with the surroundings.

All of the initial planting was from starts rather than seeds.
Native seeds can be difficult to germinate and grow, so starts were easily worth the small extra expense, especially given the number of different varieties I was planting.
Most of the plants came from the massive [Friends School Plant Sale](https://www.friendsschoolplantsale.com/).
This sale was a huge boon for my project.
Their native plant selection is excellent, the plants are good quality, and their prices are significantly better than what I would find anywhere at retail.
Plus, they had gone [fully neonictinoid-free](https://www.friendsschoolplantsale.com/blog/post/neonics) by then, a very important consideration given that this garden was meant to attract and benefit pollinators.

Knowing that I was going to go big at the sale, I developed a carrying system with a convertible hand truck so I could fit everything I needed.

My parents and Katherine helped out for installation day.
Residential-scale rain gardens are a project easily accomplished with simple hand tools.
We removed the sod with shovels (I also used my grub hoe to make things move faster), then hand dug the basin to the desired depth.
I was aiming for about 3-4" below grade at the bottom of the basin.
Stretching a string from one edge to the other let me measure down with a ruler to check our depth.
Combined with a bubble level, this also allowed me to make sure the edges of the basin matched in height.
I kept the outside edge a tiny bit lower so that if the basin overflows, the water will flow out with the grade rather than backing up towards the house.

Planting moved fast with all the helping hands.
Using the paper plan, I set seedlings out where they were to be planted, and everyone else followed behind digging them in.
I should have finished up by mulching around everything, but it had been a hectic spring and I hadn't acquired mulch yet, so I just watered everything in and left it as bare dirt for the moment.
It's recommended to use double-shredded mulch, which mats together and resists floating up when the basin fills with water.
It took me another week or so to buy and put down mulch, which unfortunately provided an opportunity for a bunch of weed seeds to germinate and cause me trouble throughout the year.

## Revisions ##

The final plan I drew up on paper has stood up quite well to implementation.
I made a few adjustments based on plant availability and moved a few things around slightly at planting time, but for the most part I was able to follow the design and it has turned out very nicely.

Almost all of the plants have succeeded.
The Rattlesnake Master and a couple of the unusual milkweeds didn't do well and seem to be gone now.
The Blazing Star suffered because it didn't come with a tag to stick in the soil and I foolishly didn't add anything at planting, so I lost track of where it was planted. Blazing Star leaves look pretty similar to grass, so I think I may have pulled it out during a weeding session without anything to warn me off.

I've only needed to change a couple plants that haven't worked in their original spots.
The Wild Golden Glow was altogether too happy with its spot in full sun with lots of moisture and grew to about 9 feet before flopping over and causing trouble for the plants around it.
I relocated it to a shadier corner by the spruce tree and it seems to be growing much more reasonably now.
I replaced it with Sneezeweed, which may also prove to be a mistake if it turns out [like it did for Hauslermo](https://projectpalermo.com/2020/06/14/orc-week-6-cursing-the-queen-and-hailing-the-halo/).
This year I plan to relocate the Royal Catchfly, which seems a little too small and dainty to hold its own with the burly prairie plants around it.
I plan to replace it with New England Aster and another try at Blazing Star, marked properly this time.

In retrospect, I could have planted with tighter spacing.
I drew up the plans using recommended spacings from Prairie Moon, but I could have tucked everything a little bit closer if I wanted a garden that felt "full" a few years earlier.
That said, doing so would have increased the plant costs, so I'm not sure I would have done so anyways.
In subsequent years I've been tucking more plants into available spaces as I discover additional species that pique my interest or have success starting less-common plants from seed.

After observing the garden's performance in major rain events over the first two years, I realized some parts of the basin needed to be deeper.
The wide portion of the basin had originally been dug deeper than the narrow portion, which caused water to flow to the deepest part instead of being distributed evenly.
I carefully dug around the existing plants to bring the other parts of the basin to an equal depth—definitely more of a nuisance than doing it prior to planting, but it worked.
The basin can now hold significantly more total water, and more plants get access to the moisture.

The other mistake I made was one that I ought to have been wise enough to avoid, given how much time permaculture spends on the concept of succession.
When planning the spacing and light tolerance for plants around the trees and shrubs, I plotted the mature size of the plants.
But the baby woody plants will take 5+ years to reach that size, and I should have thought through the sunnier and more open conditions that will exist until they do.
Luckily, most of the plants I picked out for shade in those areas (Dwarf Trout Lily, Sweet Joe Pye) seem to be handling the extra sun gracefully.
I've filled in some of the extra space with some easy sun-loving plants like Goldenrod that will be gradually phased out as they become shaded.
A garden is not a static entity, and I should have planned starting at the beginning rather than at the end.
