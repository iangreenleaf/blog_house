## The faucet ##

The faucet that came on the sink when we moved in was a light mystery.
It has a bronze finish when nothing else in the house does.
That said, it didn't look too bad and it worked fine, so decided it was good enough and left it alone.

After a couple years, however, it began to drip persistently.
We checked the easy stuff with no luck.
I asked my father-in-law what might be wrong, and got a discouraging answer that there are a variety of things that can go wrong, it can be hard to troubleshoot, and can often be hard to find replacement parts for cheap faucets.
That was all I needed to hear.
This faucet was *fine* but it wasn't worth a visit from a plumber or a huge amount of effort on my part.
Time for a new faucet.

When it comes to kitchen faucets, you have essentially three choices: you can get an $80 faucet, a $200 faucet, or a $400+ faucet.
An $80 faucet seems like asking for guaranteed trouble down the line.
Not worth it.
A $400 faucet could potentially be nicer and last a lot longer, but this probably isn't our forever kitchen, so I'm not in the market for one faucet to rule them all.
I just need something that will work well and not give us trouble for a reasonable amount of time.
So a $200 faucet it is.

After perusing a lot of options, I settled on the Grohe Veletto, a Home Depot exclusive model.
We had recently gotten several nice Grohe fixtures for our bathroom remodel after seeing a lot of enthusiasm for the quality of their products.
Getting a Grohe faucet for $199 seemed a little too good to be true, given that their non-Home-Depot models start at two to three times as much.
It seems possible that this is a case of the common big box store practice of slapping an upscale brand name on lower-quality components for a special store product line.
I decided that even if that was the case, I was still going to trust a cheaper Grohe more than any other faucet in this price range.
Plus it looks good, and the built-in soap dispenser is a nice touch.

The faucet I *wanted* to get, though, was the [Kraus Artec Pro](https://www.homedepot.com/p/KRAUS-Artec-Pro-Single-Handle-Pull-Down-Sprayer-Kitchen-Faucet-and-Pot-Filler-in-Brushed-Gold-KPF-1603BG/308947148).
Look at this beast!

Katherine said I couldn't buy this one because it "was wildly impractical" and "not something we remotely needed" and so on.
Bah!
*Katherine* and her *perfectly valid reasons.*

These industrial-styled faucets are having a moment.
I found a bunch of similar options when looking around and I do enjoy the aesthetic.
However, a lot of them were beset by lukewarm reviews, and the industrial look is all form, not function.
The commercial kitchen sprayers they are modeled on are made of much sturdier components than the consumer-level imitations, and as several commenters point out, a genuine commercial sprayer would actually completely overwhelm a residential kitchen in both size and spraying power.

I consoled myself over the loss of the pot filler with the plan that someday, I'll get a range with an industrial hood and built-in pot filler.
***Or***, if I were [Keith Morrison](https://twitter.com/dateline_keith/status/1242126350187507712?lang=en), I'd have a commercial sprayer, a pot filler, an industrial hood, **and** and a weird sign!

What were we talking about again?
Unsolved murders?
Oh right, faucets!

The old faucet came out without a fuss and the Grohe went in nice and easy.
Turns out a kitchen faucet replacement requires almost no plumbing expertise.
I put a bit of teflon tape on the threads when joining the new hoses, but that was about the extent of my skills.
The only thing that took a bit of adjustment was getting the counterweight to sit well so the pull-out sprayer retracts fully and smoothly.

The new faucet feels very substantial and well-made, so hopefully that translates into longevity.
It also looks great!
The old faucet never bothered us all that much, but now that the new one is in it's a clear aesthetic improvement.
It's a sleek modern profile that still blends in well to our non-modern kitchen.
