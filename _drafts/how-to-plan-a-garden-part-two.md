My [journey thus far]({% post_url 2021-02-04-how-to-plan-a-garden-part-one %}) in landscape design had arrived at a high-level plan for the yard that split it into segments with themes driving the design.

This was an excellent starting point for the design, but I still had to fill in a lot of details and figure out what we were actually going to put in, and where.
I already extolled the virtues of <cite>[Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/edible-forest-gardens-volume-ii/)</cite> in the previous post, so I'll spare you more of that, but suffice it to say that I learned a lot about the following planning steps from it as well, from broad concepts down to specific advice on drafting.

## A map of the territory ##

I've shown you an overview map of our lot that I used for high-level planning, but let's back up and talk about how I got that map in the first place.
We didn't have any documents to use as a starting point, so it was up to me to come up with a decently accurate map of the yard and existing features.
Here's my working document:

I sketched out the house and yard and then spent a while walking around outside measuring every component you see marked on there.
For the longer segments, I marked out about 40 feet with masking tape on a spool of rope I had found abandoned in the garage and used that with a little stake to hold one end.
This let me measure large distances like the sides of the lot fairly quickly.

With my annotated sketch in hand, I was ready to get out graph paper and start putting together an accurately-scaled drawing of the lot.
You can see I didn't measure every dimension of every feature, but rather just enough of the dimensions that the other ones can be deduced with the existing information.
Were our lot bigger or more complicated, I might have needed to use fancier techniques like triangulation to accurately locate some features, but on my map that never felt necessary.
Most features were easily placed with right angles, and I only needed it to be accurate within a couple feet anyways.

This final map was drawn on 10x10 graph paper.
I have another version drawn in Sketchup, which is the one you see in the previous post, but I didn't end up using that version much during the planning process.
The graph paper version was easier to refer back to, as I could easily count out measurements of an area I was interested in.

## TODO ##

<dl>
  <dt>Graph paper</dt>
  <dd>I got two types, 10 squares per inch and 4 squares per inch. The 10x10 is easiest to do math with, and matches up with the commone engineer's scale of 1:10.
      It's a good size for larger maps but was a little too small for doing finer designs on specific areas, like mapping out exact plant locations.
      The 4x4 graph paper was a much better scale for those drawings.</dd>
  <dt>Tracing paper</dt>
  <dd>Once I had a map drawn, I could quickly trace the boundaries onto tracing paper to make copies.
      This was handy when I wanted to try out different potential layouts or iterate several times on a design.
      There are other ways I could have dealt with this, so the tracing paper was not a necessity, but it did come in handy a few times.</dd>
  <dt>[Circle drawing template](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KIDVJE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)</dt>
  <dd>I stumbled on this by chance but it turned out to be one of the most useful tools I picked up.
      This particular template has a wide range of circle sizes that were perfect for drawing trees, bushes, and forbs.
      It's much easier and faster to draw small circles this way than with a compass, and much neater than trying to draw circles freehand.
      There are other templates with a variety of architectural shapes, but circles was all I ever needed.</dd>
  <dt>Compass</dt>
  <dd>Purchased to make circles, but the circle drawing template picked up most of the work so I didn't use this much.
      Still a useful tool to have around, and has a few uses in addition to circles, such as quickly transferring distances.</dd>
  <dt>Engineer's triangular scale</dt>
  <dd>Like an ordinary Imperial ruler, but with inches broken into fractions of 10 rather than 12.
      Used with 1:10 graph paper, you can make measurements that translate to feet with no conversion required.
      While it seemed like a great idea, I didn't end up using this very much.
      If I weren't primarily working on graph paper, or if our site were bigger and had fewer right angles, I might have needed it more often.</dd>
  <dt>[Clutch pencil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQSV7E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)</dt>
  <dd>Not a necessary purchase, but a nice complement to mechanical pencils.
      Has a wider expressive range, such as drawing thicker lines, or shading areas.
      Sturdy and will last me forever.</dd>

## Time & Materials ##

I don't have any idea how much time went into planning, as it was conducted in bits and pieces over many months.
I will say, though, that I spent a very substantial amount of time on itâ€”many tens of hours.
Some of that was because I was learning a ton about plants and ecosystems and wildlife and landscape management as I went.
Some of it was because I was very enthusiastic and went into way more depth than was strictly necessary.
Still, planning a design of this magnitude is a definite commitment.
