One cool-looking alternative I came across was the [Aquor](https://aquorwatersystems.com/) system.
The hose attachment looks very slick and it's an attractive fixture.
However, the easy quick release wouldn't do me much good for this spigot location because I typically have it hooked up to a hose reel that stays there throughout the summer.
If I were installing somewhere that I only attached a hose temporarily while in use, I would definitely consider buying in to the Aquor setup.
And if I ever get ambitious, I'd love to run an underground line to a [frost-free ground hydrant](https://aquorwatersystems.com/shop/ground-hydrant-v1/) right in the middle of the vegetable garden, which would eliminate the need for the whole permanent hose reel situation.

For now, though, I would have to settle for an ordinary sillcock.
Scoping out Home Depot and a couple plumbing supplies, there seemed to be a handful of options that were all extremely similar.
I decided the Prier model at Home Depot looked good, because it was a half-turn model and it appears to be made of all metal, rather than some plastic parts like the Everbilt model or the stupid one I was replacing.

Frost-free sillcocks come in different lengths, from 4″ up to 12″.
The original plan was to remove the existing sillcock and bring it with me to the hardware store to match to a new one.
But finding myself at the hardware store without having done that, I decided to wing it, hope I got lucky, and return it if I didn't.
Having eyeballed where it came through the wall, I thought ours looked pretty long, so I guessed 12″.

To replace the fixture, first you turn off the water and unscrew where it's mounted to the exterior wall.
Then the whole piece just unscrews from the threaded connector and can be pulled out of the wall opening.

Of course, I have dealt with enough old parts by this point to know that this sort of thing is always easier said than done.
While it's apparently possible to grip the faucet from the exterior and just muscle it counterclockwise, I passed on that technique as seeming a little too likely to rip something out of the plumbing.
Since I had access to the inside end of the connection, the best bet seemed like using two wrenches to grip each side and unscrewing it from there.

TODO photo "You can see the wrench faces on the soldered connector (left) and the end of the sillcock (right)."

Sure enough, it was a bear to get the fitting loosened.
The wrenches had to sit at an angle to reach into the wall opening, which made it difficult to keep them on the faces and easy to bash my knuckles on the surrounding concrete.
And it took a huge amount of force (pretty much the maximum muscle power I could summon) to unstick the threaded connector from its decade or two of slow solidification.
Once I got it started, the rest went pretty easy and I popped back outside to extract it from the wall.
It was at this point I was able to confirm I had guessed right on the length, so the new one I bought would fit—hooray!



The only downside to the half-turn model is that when you've turned the water back on and are gripping the faucet to get it aligned with the screw holes, and your hand slips and opens up the valve, it goes from off to a torrential stream of water in a split second.
If your other hand is positioned just right, you'll get blasted in the face with all that water, Three Stooges-style.
So yeah.
I had to get a fresh set of clothes, but I had a new sillcock!
