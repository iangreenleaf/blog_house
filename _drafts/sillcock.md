## A what now?

A "sillcock", also known as a "hose bibb", is the spigot on the side of your house that provides water and can have a garden hose attached.

We have two installed on different parts of our house, thanks to some past resident's attention to adequate plumbing options.
Conveniently, the house was already fitted with "frost free" sillcocks, which don't need to have the water supply shut off in the winter.
These are a clever design that places the actual valve inside the heated house, so when you turn the handle off, water drains out of the part of the fixture that will be exposed to freezing air and risk bursting.
This means the actual plumbing connection is inside the house, in my case easily visible in the unfinished ceiling of our basement.

While I appreciate the frost free feature, I've always disliked the actual fixtures that came with the house.
The one on the south side gets the most use and is also the most exposed to the elements.
The handle was uncomfortable to turn, you had to turn it about 5 revolutions to get it fully open, and it would squeal the entire time.
The screw that held the handle in place wouldn't properly tighten any more and needed periodic fixing.
It also leaked from the spigot when turned on, which was an annoyance since I often would like to have it on standby while I work in the garden.
Replacing it had never quite become a top priority, but then in spring of 2021 I found that the leak had become significantly worse, so it was time to act.

A bit of online research suggested that the most common failure was at the vacuum breaker, which could easily be repaired.
My sillcock, however, was leaking from the handle itself rather than from the breaker cap.
The repair path for that problem was not as simple nor as sure to succeed.
Since I didn't like this fixture anyways, and a full replacement wasn't terribly expensive, this was all the encouragement I needed to get a fresh start.

## Selection

I expected to end up sorting through a million different options, as one often does when buying house stuff.
This turned out not to be the case.
There is surprisingly little choice to be had in the world of frost-free sillcocks.
There is pretty much one design, and a handful of companies selling versions of that design that all look very similar.
I checked a couple plumbing supply houses in addition to Home Depot, and their options also looked virtually identical.
The only common technological innovation is the "half-turn" model, which allows valve to be fully opened or closed with only a half turn of the knob.
After my frustrations with the existing fixture, this was a very enticing feature to me.

One cool-looking alternative I came across was the [Aquor](https://aquorwatersystems.com/) system.
The hose attachment looks very slick and it's an attractive fixture.
However, the quick release wouldn't do me much good for this spigot location because I typically have it hooked up to a hose reel that stays there throughout the summer.
If I were installing somewhere that I only attached a hose temporarily while in use, I would definitely consider buying in to the Aquor product line.
It's a bit more expensive but the extra convenience seems worth it if it works as well as promised.
If I ever get ambitious, I'd love to run an underground line to a [frost-free ground hydrant](https://aquorwatersystems.com/shop/ground-hydrant-v1/) right in the middle of the vegetable garden, which would eliminate the need for the whole permanent hose reel situation.

For now, though, I would have to settle for an ordinary sillcock.
I decided the [Prier model](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Prier-Products-1-2-in-x-12-in-Brass-MPT-x-S-Half-Turn-Frost-Free-Anti-Siphon-Outdoor-Faucet-Sillcock-Valve-478-12/306285380) at Home Depot looked good, because it was a half-turn model and it appears to be made of all metal, rather than some plastic parts like the [Everbilt model](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-x-12-in-Brass-MIP-x-MHT-Sillcock-VFFASPG19EB/205816585) or the stupid one I was replacing.

## Installation

Frost-free sillcocks come in different lengths, from 4″ up to 12″.
The original plan was to remove the existing sillcock and bring it with me to the hardware store to match to a new one.
But finding myself at the hardware store without having done that, I decided to wing it, hope I got lucky, and return it if I didn't.
Having eyeballed where it came through the wall, I thought ours looked pretty long, so I guessed 12″.

TODO While the installation method varied quite a bit from mine, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ken6iYx0Y1g) was still a helpful starting place.

To replace a sillcock, first you turn off the water and unscrew where it's mounted to the exterior wall.
Then the whole fixture just unscrews from the threaded connector and can be pulled out of the wall opening.

Of course, I have dealt with enough old parts by this point to know that this sort of thing is always easier said than done.
While it's apparently possible to grip the spigot from the exterior and just muscle it counterclockwise, I passed on that technique as seeming a little too likely to rip something out of the plumbing.
Since I had access to the inside end of the connection, the best bet seemed like using two wrenches to grip each side and unscrewing it from there.

TODO photo "You can see the wrench faces on the soldered connector (left) and the end of the sillcock (right)."

Working from the inside like this means I was facing the opposite way for the threads, meaning that from my orientation, turning clockwise loosened and turning counter-clockwise tightened.
Luckily, working on bicycles has given me a lot of practice reasoning about thread direction.
It's always worth stopping to make sure you've got it right before you lean into the tools.
It's bad enough to be throwing all your weight into a stuck connection, but it's much worse if you've miscalculated and are tightening it instead of loosening it.

As predicted, it was a bear to get the fitting loosened.
The wrenches had to sit at an angle to reach into the wall opening, which made it difficult to keep them on the faces and easy to bash my knuckles on the surrounding concrete.
And it took a huge amount of force (pretty much the maximum muscle power I could summon) to unstick the threaded connector from its decade or two of slow solidification.
Once I got it started, the rest went pretty easy and I popped back outside to extract it from the wall.
It was at this point I was able to confirm I had guessed right on the length, so the new one I bought would fit—hooray!

I inserted the new fixture through the opening and went back inside to complete the connection.
I had bought some thread sealant (a.k.a. "pipe dope"), which is apparently the preferred plumbing material for ensuring threaded connections stay watertight.
It's a thick paste that never fully hardens, so connections can always be unscrewed later.
I brushed some sealant on the male threads and then screwed the two pieces together.
Then back outside to finish screwing it in and make sure it sat nice and tight against the house.

Once I had it good and tightened down, I turned the water shutoff back on and watched the connection to make sure it showed no signs of leaking.
I also returned later that night to check a second time.
To my great delight, it's perfect!

The only downside to the half-turn model of sillcock is that when you've turned the water back on and are gripping the spigot to get it aligned with the screw holes, and your hand slips and opens up the valve, it goes from off to a torrential stream of water in a split second.
If your other hand is positioned just so over the end of the spigot when this occurs, you'll get blasted in the face with all that water, Three Stooges-style.
So yeah.
I had to get a fresh set of clothes, but I had a new sillcock!

## Finishing touches

The face plate should be mounted to the exterior wall for stability.
I used Tapcon screws <del>for a pop of color</del> because they were the best simple option I had for mounting to whatever mix of material our exterior wall consists of.

Then I applied caulk generously around the face to seal up the outside opening.
This should prevent any water or bugs from entering the house through that hole.

Normally this is the point where my attention would wander and I'd never get around to actually painting over the caulk.
But we still had a big patch from the old mailbox that needed to be repainted as well, so I willed myself into painting both of those spots at once.

Let me tell you: this new sillcock is a delight.
The half-turn is so much more pleasant to use than the old one.
And just being able to have the water on and not have it immediately leaking all over everything is so pleasant.
The process itself wasn't a lot of fun, but it was absolutely worth doing.
