## The horrors of lead paint ##

Lead paint is bad, obviously, but people tend to get pretty unreasonable about it.
When the topic comes up on Nextdoor, one or more people inevitably show up in the thread to make tired jokes about "better just burn the house down and start over".
This sort of attitude is not evidence-based and does harm in spreading superstition instead of encouraging the proper mitigation of lead paint.

Lead paint (and asbestos) are not malevolent spirits that wander the halls of your house, looking for humans to attack.
And they're not radioactive particles that will kill you if you get too close.
Lead paint and asbestos are harmless when they stay where they are supposed to.
The danger arises when they are disturbed, either by construction work or aging.
Once disturbed, they can be inhaled or ingested and cause harm.

I suspect the mythos around lead paint and asbestos has its roots in the high price tag that often accompanies them.
When they are discovered, they often greatly complicate projects like remodels because things like sawing, grinding, or sanding are exactly the sorts of activities that transform inert lead paint or asbestos into dangerous airborne lead or asbestos dust.
If a project is going to disturb old work containing one of these and you're hiring the work out, you typically have to hire a certified contractor to do the work.
These contractors often come with a hefty price tag, in part because there's not as much competition and in part because they have to comply with very strict safety regulations.
These safety regulations aren't primarily meant to protect you; they're designed to protect the workers who may be exposed to these hazards constantly on the job.
So homeowners feel great dismay when confronted with the price of a major mitigation project, and over time that dismay gets generalized into an attitude that lead paint or asbestos are terrible, evil, and impossible to deal with.

They're not, though.
I did a bunch of research and determined that I could do this project to an acceptable level of safety as long as I had a good plan.
DIYers are not subject to the same regulations as contractors, so my safety was in my own hands.
[The EPA has a good guide to lead paint safety](https://www.epa.gov/lead/steps-lead-safe-renovation-repair-and-painting), and [The Craftsman Blog has a number of helpful articles](https://thecraftsmanblog.com/?s=lead+paint).
The way to work safely with lead paint is to not inhale it, and not leave any behind where it could be inhaled or ingested later.
Ideally, avoid creating lead paint dust at all.
Or if you must create dust, make sure the dust is contained and collected for disposal, and that you're protected while working around it.

## The plan

The big queston was how to get the paint off the doors.
Power sanding was out of the question—way too much dust.
I also ruled out another common method, heat guns.
Heat guns are apparently somewhat dangerous, as they can heat wood way too hot and cause delayed fires.
Worse, if you heat lead paint too hot you can vaporize the lead, which sounds… turbo-bad.
So no heat guns.

There is [an infrared heat gun](https://eco-strip.com/product/speedheater-cobra/) that is safer to use, but it's very expensive and I couldn't find anyone renting it.
The Craftsman Blog mentions that it doesn't always perform well on extremely dry oil-based paints, which was precisely my situation.
Buying this only to discover that it didn't work would have been very painful, so I decided not to try.

This left two options, ["dry" scraping](https://thecraftsmanblog.com/how-to-strip-paint-part-2-scrape-like-a-pro/) or [chemical strippers](https://thecraftsmanblog.com/how-to-strip-paint-part-1-chemical-strippers/).
I originally planned to scrape the paint with a vacuum-attached scraper.
However, a trial run of that method made it clear that it was not going to be feasible.
I think a large part of the problem was the paint I was dealing with.
The layers of latex paint came off okay, but the two bottom layers of (presumably) oil-based paint were absolutely rock hard.
I think scraping is also more effective on smaller widths (which is probably why Scott Sidler finds it so effective, since he's probably using it on windows).
I did end up scraping the edges of the doors and that worked fine, but the faces of the doors just had too much flat uninterrupted surface area.
I was able to scrape a small patch of the test door down to bare wood, but it took an incredible amount of time and effort, and if I tried to do the full doors that way I would never finish the project.

This left me with chemical stripping.
I hadn't wanted to use this option because, well, chemicals are gross.
But it was becoming clear that this was going to be the pragmatic choice for me, so I accepted it.
After [testing a bunch of chemical strippers](TODO), I settled on Citristrip and got to work.

## Equipment

##

TODO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfhtgWF_ETY

1. Remove hardware and plug the mortise holes with wads of paper towel.
2. Apply a thick layer of stripper, cover with plastic film, and leave overnight.
3. Using the plastic putty knife, scrape paint goop off the door. Using a second putty knife like the world's most vile Coldstone Creamery, transfer globs of paint residue to the waste bag.
4. As I go, apply a thin coat of stripper to any areas with substantial paint left behind.
5. Once the first pass of scraping is done, go back and scrape any areas that had stripper reapplied.
6. Dip steel wool or a scrub pad in mineral spirits and scour the whole surface of the door to neutralize the stripper and remove most of the remaining paint residue.
7. Using the contour scraper, scrape the details of the panels. Vacuum up the loose debris from this with the HEPA vacuum.
8. Using the HEPA vacuum and scraper, scrape any areas with remaining paint.
9. Repeat process on other side of door.
10. Scrape the edges of the door with the HEPA vac and scraper, and wipe with mineral spirits to neutralize any remaining traces of stripper.
11. Patch holes and damage with Bondo.
12. Use a random orbit sander attached to the HEPA vac to sand the patched areas and sand the whole door. By this point the door should be almost entirely clear of old paint.

1. Wipe down the doors with a damp cloth. Pick at the corners of the panels to make sure they aren't holding debris.
1. Take the door outside on a still day and prime with Kilz Original. Once dry, move back inside.
2. Patch any damaged areas I missed the first time with Bondo or wood filler.
3. Sand off extra material from the patching and junk that blew onto it outside. Lightly sand the entire primer coat.
4. Wipe down the doors with a damp rag, again.
5. Apply two coats of paint.
