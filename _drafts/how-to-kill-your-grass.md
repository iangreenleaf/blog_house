title: How to kill your grass
---

I hate lawns.
Ok, that's not exactly true.
Turfgrass excels at a few things and I do appreciate its utility in situations where it is called for.
A significant section of our yard remains turf and we plan to leave it that way.
However, we've killed a lot of grass since moving in and I think most people should kill most of their grass too.

What's wrong with lawns?
If you have 30 minutes, I refer you to [this excellent and comprehensive piece](https://longreads.com/2019/07/18/american-green/) for the answer.
I know that seems like an awful lot of words to spend on lawns, but you really won't be disappointed.
If you want the shorter version, I think that lawns in America are a bullshit status symbol that started as aspirational imitation of old-world aristocracy and mutated into a bizarre reflection of our manifest destiny fable.
And more to the point, they're an ecological disaster, a maintenance liability, and worst of all, largely useless.

"But wait," you say, "*I* use *my* lawn!"
I believe you.
Well, I believe that you get good use out of about 10% or so of your lawn.
Try a quick audit: think about the activities that take place on your lawn and where, specifically, they take place.
Barbecues, movie nights, bonfires, child and/or dog playtime, hammocking... however you use your lawn, I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of it takes place in one concentrated area.
Most likely, that area is in the back yard, in an area that feels semi-private and has convenient access to the house.
Got it?
Great!
You've now identified the only area that is truly best served by turfgrass.
Consider this: most likely, every other part of your yard would be better served by something else.

Here is a map of our property with our results notated (our house sits on a double lot, so we have more yard space than the typical city house, but the general idea holds true).
When we bought our house, literally all of it was lawn.

TODO

That one area in the back is the area that's useful as lawn.
That's where we set up chairs or blankets when we have outdoor gatherings.
That's where we relax outside on summer weekends.
That's where the dog rolls around and grunts (this is an important part of her day).
That's where the patio we intend to build will interface with the yard to provide a seamless transition between spaces.
That's where people can mingle and play yard games (as Katherine and I negotiated on proper lawn size, we eventually came to an agreement that "enough space to play Can Jam" was a reasonable metric to evaluate potential designs).

There's a secondary area on the side that gets used for hammocks and general flex space.
That will remain lawn for now, though it would be just as well served by a patio or by paths and groundcover.

Everything else, though?
Everything else was doing absolutely nothing for us as lawn.
It was just sitting there, demanding frequent mowing and being slowly overtaken by weeds since we weren't taking part in the endless cycle of herbicides and fertilizers.

Over several years, I've dramatically narrowed the gap between what *was* lawn and what *should be* lawn.
I've killed a **lot** of grass.
Of all the skills I've picked up while doing our landscaping, the one I feel most confident claiming expertise in is how to kill grass.
So, let me tell you about all the ways you can kill your grass.

## Questions to ask when you're ready to kill your grass ##

What do you want the site to look like when you're done?
Do you want it to be higher, lower, or equal to the current level of the ground?
If you're digging a rain garden, for example, you'll be removing the turf layer and then some.
If you're preparing a raised bed, your final result will be well above the existing surface.
If you're simply looking to plant it with something other than grass, the level may not change as drastically, but it's still worth considering if anything will be affected by the ground height moving up or down by an inch or two.

How strong is the "weed seed bank" on the site?
This refers to all the weed seeds that are lying dormant in the soil, ready to germinate if given the chance.
In your typical urban lot, the weed seed bank is formidable.
Turfgrass will suppress a lot of weed growth, but all those seeds are biding their time.
If the turfgrass goes away and nothing else shows up to compete, the weeds will happily take over.

How quickly and densely will you be growing replacement vegetation?
Once you've "emptied" out the space, you should have a plan for filling it back up expeditiously.
If you will be planting something dense and fast-growing, it can out-compete the weeds by getting established first and hogging all the space.
The more sparse and/or slow to establish your plantings, the more you will need to take precautions to suppress the weed seed bank.

How will you be planting?
Will you be covering the area with mulch?
Will you be planting transplants or direct-sowing seeds?
Will you be broadcasting seeds evenly across the surface, or placing them only in specific locations?

## How to kill your grass ##

### Herbicide ###

This one I've never tried.
The concept is pretty simple: get some glyphosate (aka RoundUp) and spray it evenly on all of the grass you want to be rid of.
Glyphosate works on contact and kills just about everything, but doesn't continue to have an effect after the initial application.
After a few days, you should have a bunch of dead ground that you can proceed to plant with whatever else you want to put in.
This is probably the quickest and least labor-intensive method.

I'm not a fan of poison, though, so I've never given it a try.
In theory, this sort of glyphosate application done with proper safety precautions should be fairly safe and not present an ongoing danger.
But that theory depends a little too heavily on taking the pesticide industry at their word and ignoring all the other times that this sort of thing turned out terrible in hindsight.

There are a couple other considerations that I presume would be important to take into account with this method.
First, it doesn't remove any vegetative matter, so all the dead grass and weeds and "thatch" will still be there one the surface.
Second, the glyphosate will not have any effect on the weed seed bank, so you must be prepared to act quickly to ensure that the weeds don't get established before your replacement plantings do.

For me, this option feels like a last resort.
If I had a site so large or difficult that no other option was practicable, I'd consider it.
On a small urban lot, there are plenty of other choices, and many of them offer additional advantages.

## Sod removal ##

Find (probably rent) either a manual or powered sod cutter.
These tools slice through the soil underneath the roots of the grass, and then you can roll the strips of sod up into big cylinders and remove them.
I did a bit of sod removal and replacement with a manual sod kicker, which I'll write about at some point, but I haven't used this method to clear a large area for replacement planting.

In addition to removing the grass, this method takes about half an inch of soil with it, which may or may not be desired depending on your situation.
By scraping off the entire top layer, you'll also be removing a lot of the weed seed bank, which should dramatically decrease weed pressure (it won't be effective on deep-rooted weeds like dandelions, though).
And you'll be left with nice flat clear soil, which would be perfect if you're going to be broadcasting seed.

An important note: rolls of sod quickly become heavy and unwieldy.
It will be hard work moving them, and you'll definitely want to have a plan for disposing of them.
You will generate more volume than you expect.

Also, rolling works best when it's a dense layer of turf.
If your grass is sparser or dominated by weeds (as often is the case in full shade, for example), it may crumble rather than rolling neatly.
If that happens, the advantages of this method will largely be lost.

One alternative to removing the sod is to flip it over and leave it in place, smothering the grass and presenting the underside as the new surface.
Unless you already have a sod cutter, this seems like a lot of bother for not a lot of return.
In my experience, flipping sod does an imperfect job of killing the existing plant matter.
The weed seed bank will remain a threat, and you'll still have a thick mat of vegetative matter that's difficult to plant into.

## Digging ##

Get a shovel, dig up the grass, and remove it.
Pretty straightforward!

Just about any digging tool can work, but the best is a standard square spade.
You want to be able to give it a good kick to quickly chop through the turf.
The flat edge is good for cutting straight lines to outline and divide it into manageable pieces.
Then you can angle it shallowly to chop underneath the roots and lever out chunks of sod.
If you're looking to remove more soil, that's fine too, you can just dig deeper.

Bring a wheelbarrow or other container with you to throw the material in as you go.
As with sod removal, expect to generate quite a large volume of removed dirt and plant matter, and realize that you will need to do something with all of that.

Flipping it over in place remains an alternative to removing it.
While it still has the downsides I mentioned in the sod section, what this method has to recommend it is extreme simplicity.
Digging and flipping can effectively prepare an area for planting without changing the height, requires no more than a shovel, and has no need for expensive or complicated disposal.
I used this method to prepare some of our side beds, and will discuss it more there.

An alternative to the shovel is a grub hoe (a tool similar to the average garden hoe except bigger, tougher, andmeaner).
Rather than cutting out pieces of turf, with a grub hoe you move in a line, chopping out chunks of turf as you go.
Once you get into a rhythm, you can cut up a lot of area very quickly, much faster than with a shovel.
If you're removing the material, you will still have to come back through with a shovel or your hands to pick up the pieces and chuck them in the wheelbarrow.
I used a grub hoe to remove the turf in a number of our early plantings, including the rain garden.
It's a good compromise between efficiency and flexibility when working with areas of non-uniform vegetation and non-square shapes.
