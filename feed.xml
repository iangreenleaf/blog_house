However, we closed on the house at the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that.
The timeline meant that I wasn’t going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, this was a blessing in disguise for me.
It forced me to temper my ambitions for the first year, and that gave me a whole growing season to observe and learn about the condition of the land.
Thus, when I did start making more permanent decisions I did so well-informed.
In the moment, though, it meant I had to get creative about what I could scrap together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already present was a small corner near the porch that was absolutely packed with hostas, and one small raised bed, oddly nestled against a juniper.
Not much to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-circle-garden&quot;&gt;The circle garden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one more feature in the yard that could have been a problem but instead I saw as an opportunity.
The previous residents had kept an enormous above-ground pool in the side yard for quite a few years.
The pool was gone when we moved in, but in its place was a large circular patch of totally bare dirt.
It was a good size for a garden, and planting it with vegetables was going to be a lot more fun than letting the weeds plant it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a halfhearted job of double-digging the circle to loosen up the soil.
In the process I discovered that some sections of the space had about 8” of decent soil before hitting a layer of compacted rocks and rubble—this would be a recurring theme in the yard.
It quickly became clear that digging into this compacted layer and sifting out the rocks would take far too much time and effort.
This was a temporary site, not a permanent one, so it didn’t need to be perfect.
I dug down as far as the good soil and left the stuff below it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was already past planting time, so as soon as it was ready I started putting things in the ground.
I had some seeds from previous years, and I bought some starts at the Friends Plant Sale and a couple neighborhood plant sales.
I also acquired a few plants from neighbors giving away extras, though one of those I would come to regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planks salvaged from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/20/the-garage.html&quot;&gt;the garage&lt;/a&gt; formed makeshift paths, and I got a bale of straw from a garden center for mulch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/circle-garden-july-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The garden in early July&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/circle-garden-july.jpg 1600w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbits started snipping things the moment I planted.
Luckily I was cruising the free section on Nextdoor pretty heavily around this time and had acquired some chicken wire and t-posts, so that made a makeshift fence.
At some point I got some landscape staples and used those to hold down the bottom of the fence, and that arrangement provided sufficient protection throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-bed&quot;&gt;Bonus bed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the circle garden, the small raised bed was available for use, so I planted it with tomatoes and a few flowers and other leftovers.
This bed didn’t have any critter protection, but thankfully the rabbits around here have never shown any interest in tomato plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/raised-bed-june-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The raised bed in late June&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juniper right next to the bed, however, got in the way of maintenance and harvesting.
I never figured out what the logic was in this placement.
The boards were also rotting and coming apart, so I didn’t expect this bed to exist beyond this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pretty-good-results&quot;&gt;Pretty good results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the limited amount of site preparation and the numerous imperfections in my process, I feel like I got as good of results as I could have hoped for.
There was remarkably little weed pressure–I think the pool must have been in place for so long that the weed seeds underneath it had rotted or lost viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/circle-garden-peas-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peas and marigolds in the circle garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the vegetables grew well, considering the soil hadn’t been amended or improved in any way.
I did buy some liquid fertilizer that I applied to the tomatoes and flowers a couple times.
It’s from a local company that grinds up invasive carp into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twomikes.net/?page_id=37&quot;&gt;a nutrient-rich fish juice&lt;/a&gt;.
What a great use for an unwanted species!
As you might imagine, it smells a bit fishy when applied, but that smell is gone by the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a nice crop of tomatoes, which is good because they are a top garden priority around here.
The greens were also good, with more arugula than I could harvest and a stellar performance from the “Amish Deer Tongue” lettuce, which has earned itself a permanent place in my planting lineup.
Beans and peas are always a good bet, and we had a nice mix of herbs too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say there weren’t failures.
I planted quite a few herb and flower seeds that never germinated.
Many of these were from packets I’d been holding on to for years, so it’s likely a lot of the seeds were just too old.
I tried to grow a tomato plant from saved seed, but lacking any way to start it indoors, I just direct-seeded in mid-May and it barely reached maturity before the weather got too cold.
We also impulse-purchased some Prairie Smoke plants without any specific plan on what to do with them.
Well, those are fairly reticent native perennials that take several years to establish before flowering, so not a great choice for a garden-in-transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made one more error that seemed small at the time but would come back to haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sunchoke-mistake&quot;&gt;The sunchoke mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunchokes, also known as Jerusalem Artichokes, are a perennial relative of the sunflower with tasty edible tubers.
They are also often described as an aggressive spreader, to be treated with care.
I took these warnings too lightly and paid for it.
When someone on Nextdoor offered free baby sunchokes dug from their yard, I biked over and grabbed a handful of starts, which I plopped in the middle of the circle garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake #1: &lt;em&gt;Right&lt;/em&gt; in the middle of the garden.
My thinking at the time was that they were taller so they could be flanked by shorter plants without blocking views or sun.
In retrospect, what I actually did was provide them with a ton of open soil to colonize and no barriers to keep them contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake #2: I suspect these sunchokes were a wild type.
There are cultivars that produce bigger tubers and spread less vigorously, but these were probably the undomesticated variety.
I’ve since reined in my use of free plants from neighbors, in large part because of this sort of loss of control over the finer details of what gets planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunchokes grew okay through the season, though they “lodged” (i.e. fell over) after enduring some moderate winds.
The first disappointment came when I dug them at the end of the season and discovered that they had created almost no edible tubers.
Their root systems contained a few tubers too tiny to be practical and a ton of rhizomes (long-distance horizontal roots), and if that sounds like foreshadowing it’s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real bad news arrived the following spring (2018), when hundreds of volunteer sunchoke plants appeared all around the circle garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/sunchoke-volunteers-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteer sunchokes all over the garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        I've made a huge mistake.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only were there a ton clustered around where I had planted the sunchokes the previous year, but seedlings were also showing up as far as five feet away.
Turns out those rhizomes had placed little tubers all over the place, ready to colonize.
By this time, I had seeded the circle garden with native plants, and while sunchokes are technically a native, I didn’t want them to dominate this area like they were clearly prepared to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you fight a sunchoke infestation?
It’s not easy, but it’s possible.
Mowing is an option, but it would have to be done very regularly to be effective—the sunchokes didn’t mind being cut back and would quickly regrow.
Mulching would probably work, but I suspect it would have to be a very impenetrable layer to foil these vigorous plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose a war of attrition, making frequent patrols throughout the summer to pull up every sunchoke plant I found in the area.
More would sprout, and a week later I’d pull them up again.
When I had time, I’d also use a trowel to dig out the tubers themselves so they couldn’t just send up a new stem.
This strategy did eventually work, but it took a whole summer of regular attention before I got things under control.
I probably spent more time on this than on all the other weeding I’ve done in this garden in its whole existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn’t let this ordeal put me off of growing sunchokes, and I have since planted some elsewhere that are now one of my favorite and most productive crops.
You should consider growing sunchokes too, but learn from my mistakes: grow a named cultivar, and situate it somewhere that is easy to control the spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retirement&quot;&gt;Retirement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 2018 growing season, I had established a large permanent vegetable garden elsewhere in the yard and no longer needed the circle space for food.
So now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t (and still don’t) have a strong vision for this part of the yard.
It’s on the side of our house and visible from the kitchen window, so Katherine wants something pretty to look at while she washes dishes.
We want a small open area for lounging in the sun, but I had no desire to convert all of it back into grass (I hate grass).
We could eventually want to use this space for something specific, like a playhouse, a picnic table, a… dog palace?
Something.
With the future use a question mark, I didn’t want to plant it up with very permanent stuff like fruit trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to take the path of least resistance.
The grass areas around the circle would remain grass for the moment, and I would plant the circle up with something pretty, rabbit-resistant, and low maintenance.
A native plant prairie seemed like the perfect choice.
It would look nice, it wouldn’t need much care, and since we weren’t using the space for anything else, it would be put to work providing food and habitat for native insects.
With the vegetable garden nearby, it would also provide an enticing hangout spot for predator insects who help control pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the native plants in the rain garden, I had taken a focused, careful approach, buying starts and laying them out according to a thoughtful design plan.
There was to be none of that here.
I’d put down a bunch of seed and whatever grew, grew.
There were also a few perennial food plants–rhubarb, green onions, and perennial arugula–that I left in place, figuring they could wait until I had some other permanent place to move them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a packet of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/pollinator-palooza-prairie-seed-mix-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;Pollinator Palooza seed mix&lt;/a&gt; from Prairie Moon.
As recommended, I sowed the seeds in early winter, right as one of our first major snowfalls arrived.
Many native seeds need “cold stratification” to break dormancy, so letting them winter in place is the way to achieve that with the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring 2018 was a pretty weird season.
The snow and cold hung around a long time, and then the weather turned on a dime to immediately become hot, dry, summer conditions.
I suspect this wasn’t helpful to the seeds, who didn’t have a cool moist transition period to germinate and start establishing.
The outcome that year did not look very good.
Other than some black-eyed susans, very few native plants showed up and I was concerned that the prairie planting had been a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn’t care enough to intervene, and 2019 proved much more successful.
Quite a few more natives appeared and the space started to fill in, making the threat of weeds less pressing.
We got some nice flowers, not only from the robust and ever-adventurous black-eyed susans, but from some more unusual participants like figwort and native pasture thistle.&lt;/p&gt;

        This native “pasture thistle” was a surprise hit. It’s a huge and striking plant, and the bees loved the giant blossoms.

        It’s called “bee balm” for a reason!
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did virtually no weeding or maintenance on it the entire year, and yet almost every plant I could identify was a native.
It seems that the natives, now fully established, have thoroughly out-competed the weeds.
This was always the plan in theory, but seeing it take place in practice was very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I realized I had put shockingly little work into establishing this area in general.
I had done a bit of weeding in the first two years, mostly of pesky sow thistle, but really very little time in the grand scheme of things.
The only major time investment was fighting back sunchokes, a problem of my own making.
I was probably helped somewhat by not having major weed pressure to begin with, but still, this result feels like a big win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty bucks and some patience got me an area that doesn’t need mowing, looks pretty, and provides a huge boost of biodiversity.
The wild and slightly unruly nature of it wouldn’t work in every situation (this year, notably, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/gaura-biennis-biennial-gaura-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;gaura&lt;/a&gt; grew about 7 feet tall and then epically flopped over), but in this spot it works great.
Also, the dog likes to bushwhack through this area for no obvious reason.
I swear part of the appeal for her is that if she gets into the middle, the plants are thick enough she’s completely hidden from sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whirligig&quot;&gt;Whirligig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a year, Katherine travels to rural Wisconsin to attend a barn dance.
On her way there, she passes &lt;a href=&quot;http://cottagegardenfarm.com/&quot;&gt;a garden store&lt;/a&gt; that is known in the area for making outstanding whirligigs.
Seriously.
You probably thought all whirligigs were about the same quality, but that’s just because you’ve never encountered a truly exemplary whirligig before.
These ones spin effortlessly and come with a lifetime rebalancing guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussion, we agreed to invest in a whirligig, so on her next Wisconsin trip Katherine brought one home.
We didn’t have a specific spot in mind for it, but we tried it out in the prairie area and thought it fit in very nicely, so it lives there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/whirligig-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The whirligig in the middle of the prairie garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue we have is that suicidal figwort plants keep trying to grow directly into the spinning blades and get all chewed up, so we have to keep trimming them back.
We even moved it to a different spot and somehow a new figwort appeared and dove right into the blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Garden" /><summary type="html">I had maintained a small garden at both of the last two places we rented, so now that we had a place of our own I was excited to get a garden going. However, we closed on the house at the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that. The timeline meant that I wasn’t going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Basement Egress</title><link href="https://house.youngram.com/basement-egress.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Basement Egress" /><published>2020-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://house.youngram.com/basement-egress</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://house.youngram.com/basement-egress.html">&lt;p&gt;The basement was mostly finished when we bought the house.
It still needs drywall and ceiling and a few other finishing touches, but it was already waterproofed, insulated, and had a new cement floor with in-floor hydronic heat.
Time will tell if we actually take advantage of it being finished or continue to use it as a basement, like we’re doing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ready it for use as a finished space, the final important component was an egress window.
This would allow us to have a legal bedroom down there, which is what would give the biggest boost to our property values or whatever.
Beyond looking good on paper, an egress window provides straightforward functional benefits.
It brings a lot more light into the space and makes it feel more like a room and less like a dark basement.
It also gives you a way to escape in case of fire, which is sort of the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of immediate impact on our life, an egress window wasn’t at the top of the priority list.
However, we knew that given the nature of the project we’d make it easier on ourselves if we got it done soon.
Bringing digging machinery into the yard would become more difficult once we had a full fence, and the work itself would be likely to damage any landscaping around the site.
Since a fence and major landscaping were both in the cards for the coming year, it seemed prudent to get our hardscaping out of the way while it was still simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two candidate windows along the north wall of the basement.
They are both framed out as if the original intent was to convert them to egress windows.
We thought about doing both, but that would have doubled the cost and not doubled the benefits.
A single egress window seemed like the best balance for our needs.
One of the windows was situated in a more likely spot for a future bedroom, plus it was a simpler section of wall (the other window sits in a bump-out where the first floor bay window follows down into the foundation), so it got the nod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a couple quotes but didn’t look very hard because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egresswindowguy.com/&quot;&gt;Egress Window Guy&lt;/a&gt; seemed like an easy choice.
They get a lot of good reviews on Nextdoor and Angie’s List.
They specialize in this one thing so the whole planning and quoting process is very streamlined.
Their prices are reasonable, and better yet, they have a standardized price sheet for all their options so I was able to get a very straightforward apples-to-apples comparison on the cost differences between various options.
Also, they offer a discount if you obtain an online quote by filling out a questionnaire and sending photos so they can save a site visit.
My kind of people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the effort that goes into an egress window isn’t the window itself, it’s digging a big old hole in the ground for the egress.
It was a two person operation: they brought in a mini-excavator and two wheelbarrows and one person operated the scoop while the other basically ran back and forth carrying loads of dirt to the area I had designated.
He’d run one wheelbarrow to the dirt pile while the other one was being filled, then run it back, swap for the full one, and start again.
That guy must sleep well at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a six-foot hole dug in your yard is a good opportunity to learn about the soil profile.
Once I showed interest, the guy doing the digging helpfully told me about what he had noticed.
Apparently we have a couple feet of good topsoil, then a heavy clay layer, then underneath that is fairly sandy subsoil.
Weird, but not too bad.
This was timely information as well, since I was very shortly installing a rain garden in the same side of the lawn.
In the end we get good enough drainage through the clay layer that I haven’t needed to do anything special, but if our rain garden wasn’t draining quickly, I would have considered trying to dig or punch holes through the clay, knowing that there was well-draining sand underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

        Getting the hole ready. This isn't even most of the dirt; note the trodden path leading away from it.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the hole was dug, it was just a matter of sawing through the concrete block foundation and installing a window opening.
I was busy with other stuff so I didn’t pay a lot of attention to this part, but they moved pretty fast.
The whole thing took about two thirds of a work day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was glad we made the decision to do this piece early, because it was somewhat disruptive to the site, as expected.
The crew was very respectful and did their best not to mess up the surrounding area, but digging a big hole is always going to create a bit of havoc.
It didn’t help that the ground still had melting snow on it (thanks, April of Endless Winter).
The mini-excavator left some tracks driving in, and the path used by the beleaguered wheelbarrow shuttle-man got pretty trampled and compacted.
If I already had nice landscaping in the area they were working, I would have been stressed out by this project.
As it was, the whole area was just crappy grass that was due to be torn up and converted shortly anyhow, so I didn’t mind at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t pay extra to have the dirt disposed of, so we were left with a small mountain on our back patio.
A lesson I’ve learned a couple times now: you’re always going to generate way more dirt than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did eventually relocate it all to other places around the yard, but it took us most of a year to slowly chip away at it.
I had planned to use the dirt to regrade a section of the yard near the foundation, but that didn’t make nearly as big a dent as I had expected.
A lot of it went to leveling out a low spot  in the back yard, and some more went to slightly raising the profile of the new planting areas I put in along the fence in back.
The clay subsoil was the hardest thing to use up, as it was heavy enough to not perform well in planting beds.
That eventually led to the creation of a great ephemeral masterpiece (to be covered in a later post), so I guess I just needed to take the whole journey to reach the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished window looks very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the details of the window options but we got an Anderson 400 Series, I believe because it was a step up from the basic option and my research suggested it would do an acceptable job.
We splashed out for the more spendy timber lining on the well itself instead of a basic galvanized metal sheet.
I’m very glad we did, even though it raised the price considerably.
A window with a galvanized well would be &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; and would do the job adequately, but I don’t think it would actually make the room better.
The timber well is attractive enough that the window becomes an asset and really adds to the ambiance of the room.
It’s also much prettier from the outside.
Galvanized wells are always a little funky and tend to feel like something you want to screen, while this one serves as a feature in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

        The timber well meshes wonderfully with the new landscaping.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider opening also lets in more light and gives a feeling of expansiveness from inside.
This part of the basement feels a lot cheerier than it did with the small dim window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the window installed, the only thing left for me to do was finish the interior trim, so I got right to work.
Ha ha!
Just kidding, it’s been three years and I haven’t touched it.
I only took the stickers off the window just now to take this photo.
When we finish the rest of the basement, we’ll finish the window interior.
Until then, it just isn’t a priority.
It’s still the best-looking part of the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many partially-completed projects we inherited when we bought the house was the fireplace and chimney.
The previous owners had installed a nice new fireplace and judging by the soot buildup, they had enjoyed it frequently.
One problem: they never finished the chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being a fancy new fireplace, the exhaust vents through a double- or triple-walled aluminum stovepipe rather than a traditional opening.
The actual chimney part is just for structure and looks.
It’s wood framing clad with plywood and tar paper and finished with something weatherproof and decorative.
Only the previous owners never made it to “finished” and just left it at plywood and tar paper instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looked pretty bad, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-chimney/resized/before-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of the chimney clad in tar paper&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-chimney/before.jpg 3984w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also had functional concerns: the tar paper is a moisture shield but there’s no real guarantee that it will be effective if it has to do all the work itself.
Getting moisture under the tar paper, rotting the plywood and entering the rest of the house seemed like a recipe for a bad time.
The chimney was high on our priority list for these reasons, but the final straw was when a woodpecker started visiting daily to peck at the chimney.
It felt like it was mocking us for our shortcomings and portending worse problems in the future.
&lt;em&gt;I GET IT, WOODPECKER, WE SHOULD HAVE COVERED THIS UP BY NOW!&lt;/em&gt;
After a week of being blatantly taunted by a bird, I resolved to finish the chimney once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was relatively sure I knew what we needed.
The structural parts of the chimney were all there, we just needed to cover it with something that provided permanent weatherproofing and looked like an actual finished product.
Apparently it’s common to put siding on these types of chimneys (because the outer structure doesn’t actually experience much heat), but I was never convinced that we could pull that off in a way that was anything but ugly.
The chimney is quite tall, presumably because it needs to extend beyond the second floor, and it comes directly out of the roof so it doesn’t have any visual connection to the rest of the exterior walls.
Turning it into a weird pillar of siding seemed like a great way to call attention to how awkward it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-chimney/resized/mockup-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A mockup of the chimney with matching siding&quot; srcset=&quot;

        A mockup. See? It's weird.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous owners had planned to do river stone to match the fireplace finish, but we are not that into river stone and besides, it wouldn’t fit the style of the neighborhood at all.
Longfellow is a lot of old houses and of those that still have visible chimney elements, it’s a split of about 90% red brick and 10% yellow brick.
Brick seemed like the easy choice, if we could make it work.
Some research led me to “thin brick”, which is thin slices of brick face that get attached to a backing element like, say, the structural column of a modern chimney.
Thin brick is still true brick material and still gets mortared in, so it reportedly has durability comparable to actual brick.
It doesn’t have the immense weight of full brick, so it doesn’t require the support structure that a traditional masonry chimney would.
Seemed like we had a winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding someone to actually do the job proved much more difficult.
Chimney companies told me I should find a mason.
Masons told me they didn’t do veneers.
Contractors told me I should put siding on it.
Siding companies told me they only did full-house jobs.
The city inspector told me I needed to have it inspected because he didn’t think it was to code (it was).
The overall hassle of finding someone who wanted to do the job felt very disproportionate to the actual size of the job. Welcome to home ownership, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After not seeing much success through other routes, I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thumbtack.com/&quot;&gt;Thumbtack&lt;/a&gt; a try and it worked out well for me (they have since changed their business model so I wouldn’t necessarily vouch for them any more).
We got matched up with several worthwhile contractors, including the one we went with, Ryan at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativeconceptsconcrete.com/&quot;&gt;Creative Concepts&lt;/a&gt;.
Ryan not only had the best quoting process and communication, his bid came in well under all the others, so it ended up being an easy decision.
I suspect Ryan may have underbid the job and regretted it later, but if that was the case he was a total professional about it and never turned it into my problem.
He and his crew did great work and (as far as my untrained eyes can tell) the results are excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lined the job up to be part of our spring of construction, hoping that we could get the chimney folks done and out of the way before the egress window and fence folks started.
It worked out in the end, though it wasn’t quite as simple as any of us hoped.
The installation was, in theory, a pretty straightforward affair.
Erect scaffolding, check the existing structure and put up metal lathing.
The tar paper had done an admirable job protecting the structure from the elements, so the crew replaced it but was able to leave the wood structure untouched.
After an inspector checked it, they’d spend a couple days brick &amp;amp; mortaring and we’d be all done.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, winter decided to perform a Minnesota goodbye that year.
The poor crew had a snowstorm roll in halfway through the bricklaying, and the temperature dropped enough that they couldn’t keep putting up mortar because it wouldn’t cure properly.
So work got suspended for over a week while April refused to act like spring.
Ryan was very communicative and kept apologizing for the delays, which I appreciated, but it’s not like I expected him to be able control the weather.
These things happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These delays would have messed up the scheduling with the other contractors, but the cold was causing delays for everything else too, so it worked out okay.
The egress window had to wait until there wasn’t feet of snow on the ground, and our fence builder couldn’t start until the ground thawed, so everything ended up happening in the original order, just several weeks late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that the chimney looks like brick, that it fits the style of our house and fits the style of the neighborhood.
It doesn’t draw attention to itself any more and that was exactly the goal.
Most of all, I like that I just won’t think about it very often.
If it’s as durable as promised, I should have decades before it needs any attention, and the freedom to spend less time worrying about my chimney is a worthy investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing your chimney: would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

This was an obvious place for us to start because it felt like a very doable entry point, and because it was pretty urgent. Why? Let’s review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/exterior-view-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of the garage exterior&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/exterior-view-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/exterior-view-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/exterior-view-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/exterior-view.jpg 6016w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garage is… not in great shape.
It’s as old as the house and not built with the same sort of care as the house.
The framing sits directly on the ground, and after a hundred years of ground contact, the wood is in pretty bad shape!
Due to this slow loss of structural integrity, the whole thing has a pretty noticeable lean to it.
We’ll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the structural issues, a previous owner had converted a third of the garage into the grimiest of hangout caves.
Plastic sheeting had been hung to create a room of sorts and the walls had been partly insulated (more on that in a moment).
When we toured, the space was still furnished with a couch, recliner, TV and stereo system, and most concerningly, a wood-burning stove.
Truly a four-season hidey-hole.
Part of me perversely hoped they would leave behind the stove, but by the time we closed it was gone with only the patched chimney hole to mark where it had been.
Probably worth good money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a photo of the cave in its full glory as it was truly a sight to behold.
Even photos, though, wouldn’t capture to most distinctive feature of the garage as we got it: the smell.
It reeked overpoweringly of cigarette smoke.
The smell was so potent I found it truly difficult to spend more than a few seconds in the garage.
I would gulp a big breath a few feet from the door and try to hold it until I had gotten what I needed and retreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to be able to use the garage, so we needed to address the smell and general grossness.
Our best bet seemed to be stripping it as much as we could.
The weird slapdash shelves had to go.
The haphazard light fixture in the back had to go.
And most importantly, the very handmade and smoke-impregnated insulation had to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demo-day&quot;&gt;Demo day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the hardware store for a few basic supplies to prepare: dust masks, trash bags, and most crucially, the biggest crowbar I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/crowbar-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very large crowbar&quot; srcset=&quot;

        This was an excellent purchase.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most expendable clothing worn, gear donned. It was time, as Monty Don would put it, “to get stuck in”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/katherine-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Katherine with safety gear working on demo in the garage&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/katherine.jpg 3024w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first surprise was that the wall insulation was entirely wood shavings.
It looked like someone with a woodworking hobby had spent some unfathomable number of years collecting the dust and planer shavings and pouring them into the walls.
Kind of impressive, but I’d also prefer a structure that isn’t ready to turn into Minneapolis’ biggest bonfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/insulation-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A removed wall panel with wood shaving insulation behind it&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/insulation-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/insulation-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/insulation-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/insulation.jpg 3894w&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Cool. Cool cool cool.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our time was spent prying off the old planks holding the insulation in and bagging up the wood shavings.
The planks I saved and used for temporary garden paths and other scrap purposes.
The wood shavings we put on Craigslist and were quickly collected by some nice folks excited to mulch a strawberry bed with them.
I probably could have saved them for my own garden, but I was so disgusted by the whole deal that I just wanted them gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an extra fun surprise, some of the insulated sections contained interesting items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/knives-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two old knives&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/knives-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/knives-800.jpg 800w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/knives.jpg 1080w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two knives buried in the shavings.
I’d give it a 40% probability that at least one of these was used in a murder, because why else would you hide knives in the walls of a garage?!
The big one is a nice form factor for stabbing into a wood surface.
For some reason it annoys Katherine when I leave it like this, so I took to periodically moving it to a different stud in the garage just to keep her on her toes.
I suspect she has recently confiscated it and hidden it from me.
I’ll find it, though.
&lt;em&gt;I’ll find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/wtf-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A patch of fur with a leather strap&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/wtf-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/wtf-800.jpg 800w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/wtf.jpg 1080w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also this horrifying patch of… fur and leather?
I cannot imagine what this is and I have made a point not to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only things we kept were the shop lights mounted to the rafters and a battered but sturdy workbench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the siding and shelves removed, we pulled most of the stray nails out of the walls, swept out a decade of rubble and cigarette ash, and left the garage door open for a couple days.
It worked!
The cigarette smell went from overpowering to simply noticeable, and it has since faded completely.
Our garage was clear and relatively clean, and we could start using it for our own stuff.
If I were smart I would have taken a photo of it at this stage to illustrate for you our perfect minimalist lifestyle.
I am not, and we immediately filled it with disorganized piles of our own junk, something which we have still not fully gotten back under control two years later.
Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/mess-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very messy section of the garage&quot; srcset=&quot;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-the-open-door-policy&quot;&gt;Changing the open-door policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we put anything of value in the garage, though, there was one more issue to address.
The service door was what I would describe as “not a real door”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/old_door-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The old door on the garage&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/old_door-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/old_door-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/old_door-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/old_door.jpg 4032w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely an interior door that someone had repurposed at some point.
The hinges were on the outside, which would be a security problem if not for the fact that the locking latch was so tenuously attached that I think I probably could have compromised it with my bare hands.
Garage break-ins are enough of a problem in South Minneapolis that I did not want to be the easiest garage on the block to break into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a project, though.
The door frame was a weird nonstandard size that no door would fit.
And remember that lean?
Turns out an important tenet of hanging doors is to try to do it on something that is relatively plumb and square.
This opening was neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time to call for backup, namely Jeff my handy father-in-law and his Sawzall.
He advised that we buy a standard door and alter the opening to fit, so I found the cheapest metal security door that looked decent, strapped it to the roof of the car in the always-eerily-abandoned parking lot of the West St. Paul Lowes, and drove it home.
Jeff came over for a long Saturday in which we pulled out some of the existing framing, cut a larger opening in the siding, added new studs and support beams, and installed the door.
It was a precision operation to get it in a place where it would clear both the concrete floor of the garage and the overhead rails for the automatic garage door.
After a lot of adjusting and checking and adjusting some more, we got it in and attached and to my great relief, it works well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/new_door_interior-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The new door viewed from the garage interior&quot; srcset=&quot;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that it isn’t without its quirks.
Remember how I told you about the garage’s pronounced lean?
We had a decision on whether to install the door square with the rest of the garage, or plumb with the actual ground.
We chose plumb, and I am entirely confident this was the right decision, but this does mean that the door is very obviously out of alignment with the rest of the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/new_door-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The new door installed in the garage, which is noticeably not aligned with the windows or roofline&quot; srcset=&quot;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        This is not an optical illusion. That's… just how it is.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the door there really accentuates just how much the rest of the structure is listing.
It’s fine.
I’m sure it’s totally fine.
Nothing to worry about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime later, I finally got around to installing some trim that I bought from our local salvage shop.
It looks okay.
Go me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/trim.jpg 2265w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also eventually installed a security light in place of the old lamp that had been on that electrical box, but it is such an utter hack job that I’m not even going to document it.
It’s nice to have a proper light there, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organization&quot;&gt;Organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working on organizing the garage for the rest of our lives, plus or minus a couple years.
We’ve made some progress, at least, which I will share with you in the spirit of incremental good-enough-ism that permeates this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought some 4’x8’ sections of the cheapest pegboard and transported them precariously home on the roof of our Subaru.
Next time just buy the 4’x4’ sections, Ian you dummy.
Those would be way easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screwed one panel to the studs on each side of the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/pegboard_with_cutouts-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pegboard with cutouts for the window and outlet box&quot; srcset=&quot;

        Notice the crowbar presiding over its domain.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one went right over the window and electrical box because I was far too lazy to measure and cut out holes prior to attaching it.
Two years later, after purchasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dremel.com/en_US/products/-/show-product/tools/multi-max-mm50&quot;&gt;an oscillating multi-tool&lt;/a&gt;, I finally got around to cutting these out, totally professionally!
This one will probably hold workshop tools, at whatever future date I dig out and organize the workbench so I can use that area as an actual workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side holds gardening tools and a few other yard items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        I feel prouder of my organization on the near side of this one.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out with this tool rack that my father has been storing in the basement (in original packaging) for presumably several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/old_tool_rack-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Large garden tools on hanging rack&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/old_tool_rack.jpg 3484w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped a lot to corral all the larger implements in one place, but the hooks on the rack didn’t work for everything, and it was bending considerably under all the weight.
I looked around and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-36-in-80-lb-Aluminum-8-Clamp-Wall-Rack-Organizer-18021/202305428&quot;&gt;a rack at Home Depot&lt;/a&gt; that looked decent and was cheap.
One problem: it’s drilled for standard 16” studs, and in the garage the studs are 24” for whatever reason.
Am I going to let that stop me?
Heck no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just drill a new hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rack seems sturdy and the gripper mechanisms hold the tools well.
Hopefully it will hold up over time, but even if it doesn’t, it was cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/storage_shelf-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large metal storage shelf&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Costco’s version of your classic metal storage shelf, and like everything from Costco they are 30% larger than the standard version.
Luckily they just barely fit in the space, and give us a lot of space for miscellany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooks on the walls hold bike tires, hoses, and cords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studgrabbers.com/&quot;&gt;these awesome stud-grabbing hooks&lt;/a&gt; from the Grandstand at the State Fair, and I didn’t even mind paying Grandstand pricing because they are so darn nifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our everyday-use bikes go in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Feedback-Sports-Bicycle-Storage-Stand/dp/B006JXYGW0&quot;&gt;these lovely Feedback Sports stands&lt;/a&gt; we’ve had for years.
The front of the garage hosts the most frequently-accessed items, like the bikes, tools, wheelbarrow, and lawn mower.
The back of the garage is a dark tangled forest of chicken wire and scrap wood.
I don’t go back there any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/tandem-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tandem bike hanging from ceiling hoist&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/tandem-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/tandem-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/tandem-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/tandem.jpg 3036w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acquired a tandem bike from a family member, which seemed like the perfect use for a bike hoist I had picked up years earlier.
I screwed up some 2x4 supports to mount that to the rafters.
The bike hangs and our bike trailers and lawn mowers go on the floor under and around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-it-for-now&quot;&gt;That’s it for now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday this garage will lean a little too far and fall over.
We’re hoping that’s a few decades out still, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/branch-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A fallen tree branch that landed on the garage&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/branch-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/branch-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/branch-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/branch.jpg 4032w&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        This branch tried to kill the garage. It did not succeed.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, it’s certainly not a perfect space but it’s good enough, and I’m happy that we’ve made it functional for our lives with only a very small investment of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sides of the entrance had a bunch of random auto parts stickers.
I scraped all of them off with a putty knife except for this Pabst one, which I think I’ll leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/the-garage/resized/pbr-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An old Budweiser sticker&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that I actually like PBR (gustatorily &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; ideologically), but I like that it is legitimately vintage at this point, and it serves as a very small reminder of what this garage has seen, and of the weird chain-smoker who loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll try to keep it interesting, but if you’re expecting a lot of polish, you’re probably in the wrong place.
In order for this thing to work, I need to keep posting to it.
The only way that’s going to happen is if I establish an achievable bar for myself and the amount of time I have available to me: no masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most photos will be taken in the midst of the project, with whatever camera I have at hand, with a minimum of staging, in whatever lighting conditions are easily available.
In other words, they won’t be perfect.
If you’re expecting the gorgeous visual record of, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectpalermo.com/&quot;&gt;Project Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, you’re going to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also practical people, and are focused on making functional changes that improve the house and make it a better fit for our lives.
In other words, many of our projects are not all that glamorous.
I lean towards completeness over pizazz, so I intend to write about even the less exciting projects to give a more accurate depiction of what our house project life actually looks like.
It’s not all sledgehammers and shiplap, y’know?
I’ll try to spare you too much boredom, at least, by writing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; about the interesting stuff and &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; about the boring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also by no means experts in any aspect of home renovation or landscaping.
I tend to do my research, but that won’t always take the place of many years of experience.
So you won’t be getting expert advice here; it’ll be more like going through the learning process &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; me.
And when I make mistakes, I’ll talk about those too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the--question&quot;&gt;The 💰💰💰 question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing about money, especially in the context of home ownership, is always a little uncomfortable.
I cannot, and probably should not, turn a blind eye to the immense amount of privilege that put us in a position where we can own a nice home in a nice neighborhood in a nice city.
We’re extremely lucky to not only own a home but to have some extra money available to improve it.
Not everyone is so lucky, and there’s no way to embark on this sort of journey without participating in the existing state of economic inequality in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I don’t think it does anyone any good to dance around the topic.
There’s a lot to be learned by seeing how much someone else pays for what, so I plan to give you the numbers, in as much detail as I can, for most of our projects.
Sometimes you’ll find we pay surprisingly little.
Other times we’ll pay a lot.
When we make financial decisions, I’ll try to talk about how we reached those decisions and what other options were available to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject, we might as well tackle the biggest financial decision of all: the house! Our house cost almost exactly three hundred thousand dollars.
Well, our final accepted offer was $301K, plus we paid closing costs.
We beat out a number of other offers and I’m fairly confident that was only as much as we needed to pay to get the place.
Had we been ready to buy the previous fall when the house sat on the market for a while, we probably could have had it for $289K.
Still, when I look around at our house and yard, I can’t help but feel like we got a steal.
There’s probably a little objective truth to that–the market has only gotten more competitive since then and our house would probably receive more offers and sell for more today.
Mostly, though, it’s a subjective truth.
The house was a steal &lt;em&gt;for us&lt;/em&gt; because it fits us so well, because its strengths are the things that are important to us and its weaknesses are things we don’t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a house for the first time is &lt;strong&gt;terrifying&lt;/strong&gt;.
We are not big spenders, and buying a Subaru the year prior had been totally foreign ground to us in terms of purchase size.
Now all of the sudden we were wiring off $75K for a down payment!
The wire transfer process, but the way, is an entirely insane way to process house payments.
The lender very helpfully points out to you that if it goes to the wrong account, they’re probably never getting the money back, so MAKE SURE YOU TYPE THE NUMBERS CORRECTLY, HA HA HA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katherine and I had never carried a notable amount of debt in our lives (see: privilege), so signing off on a 30-year mortgage was frightening as well.
Even worse is the mortgage disclosure (required by law) that informs you how much you will pay in combined principle and interest if you pay back on schedule
😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most helpful thing we did to prepare on the money side was that we spent a lot of time thinking about buying a house before we bought a house.
We knew what kind of price ranges were available to us, we knew what sort of down payment and monthly mortgage payments we’d be looking at and what would be comfortable given our existing budget.
That’s not to say we were perfectly prepared; the cost of repairs and maintenance in particular was very hard to get a good prediction for, so we ended up winging it a bit by virtue of having enough cushion of extra cash to absorb a couple unexpected blows.
I would have been more worried about those costs if our house had many issues that urgently needed fixing.
Luckily, almost all the unfinished projects in the house were optional improvements, so we felt comfortable that if we couldn’t afford some of them, they would simply remain unfinished until we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most good things in life take a combination of good fortune and good choices.
Good fortune: we have sizable savings and income, and the housing market in Minneapolis is not outrageous like many of the West Coast cities.
Good choices: we saved carefully and bought a house later in life, and we don’t cultivate lavish tastes or reach beyond what we can safely afford.
Between these two, our planning was good enough and we aren’t walking a razor’s edge of being able to afford our house.
This in turn opens the door to future possibilities of what we can achieve when we have extra capital to push around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our good fortune finds us undeserved.
Some of it is just good choices, aged a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you today with a breakdown of our purchase and moving costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

 https://house.youngram.com/assets/images/house_orig_front.jpg 6000w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, we didn’t so much find the house as the house found us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2017, we were starting to &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; about looking at houses, but we were not yet &lt;strong&gt;looking&lt;/strong&gt; at houses.
We had started a casual preliminary conversation with a realtor (the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thevoreisteam.com/&quot;&gt;Robin Voreis&lt;/a&gt;, who would soon become our official realtor), but no paperwork had been signed and no commitments made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I was out biking through the neighborhood when I passed a “For Sale” sign.
As I glanced over some magnificent evergreens caught my eye, and that was enough to get me to pull over for a closer look.
A good-sized 2.5 story house… double corner lot… lots of sun…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well shoot,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;We better at least take a look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home I mentioned it to Katherine and it turned out that she had been trolling online realty listings and had noticed the very same house and was planning to tell me about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well shoot,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;Maybe we better get a showing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I called Robin back and told her that even though two days before I had told her we’d be getting started in “about a month”, the timeline had changed to “right now” and could she please schedule a showing?
Inside was a lot of classic original South Minneapolis trim, no major problems, and just enough flaws to keep it within our price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well shoot,&lt;/em&gt; we thought. &lt;em&gt;Guess we better put in an offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then our offer was accepted(!) and it was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, we bought the first house we looked at.
What can I say?
Love hits when it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing about this was the house-hunting process I imagined we would have, but I don’t regret a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll cover the house more in a future post, but for now I’ll leave it there.
