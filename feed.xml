The infrequently used path on that side of the house crosses those two channels.
Once I got them fixed up nice with aluminum edging, I wanted to do something at the crossings to prevent the edging being crushed and cut down on debris being kicked into the channels.
I decided a couple tiny garden bridges would be in order.
There are a few houses in the neighborhood with very cute little bridges that served as inspiration and gave me a rough idea of what I was aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed the bridges to remain small and informal to match the vibe of the garden on that side, which is very naturalistic and fluid.
Bridges with handrails or other formal elements would feel out of place, and bridges that were too large would dominate the space instead of blending in.
I also wanted to be able to cross them with a wheelbarrow, so no steps.
I planned to use cedar, since the natural wood look would be perfect and cedar holds up well to outdoor use and ground contact.
Treated lumber was an option as well, but given how small these would be, the price difference wasn’t going to be all that huge and I’d just as soon have the natural option.
Each channel is only about a foot wide, so each bridge only needed to be 2-3 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find much in the way of pre-fab options.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/pd/All-Things-Cedar-3-Ft-Cedar-Bridge/1000998144&quot;&gt;This kit&lt;/a&gt; is pretty close to the perfect shape and size, but it was out of stock with no restock date when I was looking, and it’s pricier than I wanted, especially since I needed two of them.
Building my own seemed like the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-1&quot;&gt;Try #1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research to scope out the different options.
I was intrigued by a couple designs I found that used formed laminated beams for the arches.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildeazy.com/garden-bridge/&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; is larger and fancier than I needed but very nice and well-documented.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Japanese-Bridge/&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; was closer to size and has a simple and elegant style that really nailed what I was going for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some math and picked up the lumber I expected to need: 1x2s to layer for the beams and 1x4s for the planks, plus some glue and exterior screws.
On a sunny day I set about creating the jig in the yard to bend the beams.
I had some nice hefty garden stakes to pound into the ground and chopped up some scrap lumber for the brace pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-jig-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-jig-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-jig-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-jig-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/bending-jig.jpg 1527w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I realized the flaw to my plan: the beams were only going to bend so much, and the shorter the length, the less total bend would be achieved.
My short bridge design didn’t have as much length to bend as some of the examples I had been using as guides.
Even after adjusting the jigs a couple times to bend the 1x2s to their absolute maximum, I was only getting a little over one inch of rise at the centerpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-results-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The rise of a bent beam over a straight reference piece&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-results-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-results-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/resized/bending-results-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/garden-bridges/bending-results.jpg 1244w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed the bottom of the bridges to clear the edging at each side of the channel with a little extra space to accommodate settling over time, and this wasn’t going to be enough.
Plus, it was so little bend that the aesthetics of it might also be lost.
I decided to change course.
Could I have cut the beams thinner and laminated more pieces together to get a bigger bend?
Or could I have soaked or steamed the wood to make it more pliable?
I don’t know, maybe.
But I was trying not to overcomplicate the project, and I wasn’t so wedded to the laminated beam design to keep chasing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-2&quot;&gt;Try #2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option to form the arches is to take a wide piece of lumber and cut it to shape.
Luckily, I happened to have a long cedar 2x6 that I had picked up speculatively on discount, so it was easy to pivot to this design.
I used some thin PVC pipe I had on hand to rough out a nice curve for the bridge shape with about the rise I was looking for, and then just freehand sketched the details to get what seemed like a good bridge shape.
I cut out the pieces with a jigsaw.
I had to pause at this step to borrow a jigsaw from my father-in-law because my thrift store jigsaw literally didn’t have the power to make a long cut through 2″ cedar.
Once I had one piece cut out, I traced it to make the outline for the other pieces so they’d all roughly match.
This being a rustic outdoor piece, the match didn’t need to be perfect so it was enough to just eyeball it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planks were easy since they’re all exactly the same.
When cutting a bunch of pieces like this, it’s worthwhile to make a little system for repeatable actions.
I rigged a stop block to the miter saw so I could cut the same length without measuring.
If I had a nicer miter station, I would have a fence and adjustable stops to be able to do this without so much clamping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pieced together a little ad-hoc jig to drill pilot holes for the screws, so they would be consistent on all the planks.
This isn’t really necessary, but it assuages my desire for uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the planks were ready, I did a sort of dry fit by laying them out on the beams to check the spacing.
I got lucky and the width of the planks with a small gap in between worked out to cover the span fully without a fractional piece.
With the spacing roughed out, I started screwing them in, checking periodically as I went to make sure it was still on track to line up at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a simple jig for this part too—really just a piece of scrap with a cutout piece to help me quickly align each plank with consistent overhang at the sides of the beams.
Since my screw holes were all at a consistent spacing, this meant that the screws would always be hitting the center of the beam.
It’s a little thing, but it helped me move a lot faster since I didn’t have to visually inspect the alignment of each plank, and helped me hold the piece tight as I screwed it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

        The thicker part sits against the beam while the plank fits into the cutout, giving a good consistent 1/8″ or so of overhang.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I added some “spreaders” along the bottom to give the bridges a little more strength and rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if these were necessary, but they didn’t hurt.
These were cut from lumber originally slated for the laminated beams.
I had just acquired a pocket hole jig and was eager to try it out, so I attached these with pocket screws, which worked great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I was done!
To finish them, I added a couple coats of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thompsonswaterseal.com/home&quot;&gt;Thompson’s Waterseal&lt;/a&gt;, mostly just because the previous homeowners had left behind most of a jug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stuff gets pretty poor reviews online, and it didn’t put up a very impressive showing here: it had entirely worn off in under twelve months (and remember that these bridges get only light use and are in shade for more than half the year).
I’m debating whether or not to periodically recoat them.
The cedar should hold up for many years with or without treatment, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still have a lot of Waterseal left, and it’s ineffective enough that I probably won’t use it on other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, I’d make the angles of the entry and exit just a little shallower to make it easier to roll a wheelbarrow across them.
It’s possible to get a wheelbarrow over them as they currently exist, but you have to be a little careful about the angles.
Luckily I’m not crossing with a wheelbarrow very often, so in practice this is a very minor issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love the way these turned out.
They are sturdy and super cute!
They feel very much a part of the landscape, and enhance the garden path without distracting from the rest of the garden.
They also function very well, doing the job I wanted them to do of protecting the channel edging and keeping debris out of the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s not entirely true.
Turfgrass excels at a few things and I do appreciate its utility in situations where it is called for.
A significant section of our yard remains turf and we plan to leave it that way.
However, we’ve killed &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of grass since moving in and I think most people should kill most of their grass too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with lawns?
If you have 30 minutes, I refer you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://longreads.com/2019/07/18/american-green/&quot;&gt;this excellent and comprehensive piece&lt;/a&gt; for the answer.
I know that seems like an awful lot of words to spend on lawns, but you really won’t be disappointed.
If you want the shorter version, I think that lawns in America are a bullshit status symbol that started as aspirational imitation of old-world aristocracy and mutated into a bizarre reflection of our manifest destiny fable.
And more to the point, they’re an ecological disaster, a maintenance liability, and worst of all, largely useless.
Don’t want to hear it from me?
How about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9I2YwmV8M&quot;&gt;a message from Chicago’s most Chicago botanist&lt;/a&gt; instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But wait,” you say, “I use my lawn!”
I believe you.
Well, I believe that you get good use out of a small fraction of your lawn—maybe, say, 20%.
Try a quick audit: think about the activities that take place on your lawn and where, specifically, they take place.
Barbecues, movie nights, bonfires, child and/or dog playtime, hammocking… however you use your lawn, I’m willing to bet that the vast majority of it takes place in one concentrated area.
Most likely, that area is in the back yard, in an area that feels semi-private and has convenient access to the house.
Got it?
Great!
You’ve now identified the only area that is truly best served by turfgrass.
Consider this: every other part of your yard would probably be better served by something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a map of our property with the results of our usage audit notated (our house sits on a double lot, so we have more yard space than the typical city house, but the general idea holds true).
When we bought our house, literally all of it was lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/map-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our property with areas to keep as grass notated&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/map-480.png 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/map-800.png 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/map-1200.png 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/map.png 1800w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one area in the back is the area that’s useful as grass.
That’s where we set up chairs or blankets when we have outdoor gatherings.
That’s where we relax outside on summer weekends.
That’s where the dog rolls around and grunts (this is an important part of her day).
That’s where the patio we intend to build will interface with the yard to provide a seamless transition between spaces.
That’s where people can mingle and play yard games (as Katherine and I negotiated on proper lawn size, we eventually came to an agreement that “enough space to play Can Jam” was a reasonable metric to evaluate potential designs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a secondary area on the side that gets used for hammocks and general flex space.
That will remain lawn for now, though it would be just as well served by a patio or by paths and groundcover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else, though?
Everything else was doing absolutely nothing for us as lawn.
It was just sitting there, demanding frequent mowing and being slowly overtaken by weeds since we weren’t participating in the endless cycle of herbicides and fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over several years, I’ve dramatically narrowed the gap between what &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; lawn and what &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; lawn.
I’ve killed a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of grass.
Of all the skills I’ve picked up while doing our landscaping, this is the one I feel most confident claiming expertise in.
So, let me tell you about all the ways you can kill your grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions-to-ask-when-youre-ready-to-kill-your-grass&quot;&gt;Questions to ask when you’re ready to kill your grass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you want the site to look like when you’re done?
Do you want it to be higher, lower, or equal to the current level of the ground?
If you’re putting in a rain garden, for example, you’ll want to go below grade.
If you’re preparing a raised bed, your final result will be well above the existing surface.
If you’re simply looking to plant it with something other than grass, the height may not matter as much, but it’s still worth considering if anything will be affected by a change of an inch or two in either direction.
Some grass killing techniques will change the final height of the surface, which may or may not be what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How strong is the “weed seed bank” on the site?
This refers to all the weed seeds that are lying dormant in the soil, ready to germinate if given the chance.
In your typical urban lot, especially one that’s been a bit neglected, the weed seed bank is formidable.
Turfgrass will suppress a lot of weed growth, but all those seeds are still present, biding their time.
If the turfgrass goes away and nothing else shows up to compete, the weeds will happily take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How quickly and densely will you be growing replacement vegetation?
Once you’ve “emptied” out the space, you should have a plan for filling it back up expeditiously.
If you will be planting something dense and fast-growing, it can out-compete the weeds by getting established first and hogging all the space.
The more sparse and/or slow to establish your plantings are, the more you will need to take precautions to suppress the weed seed bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will you be planting?
Will you be covering the area with mulch?
Will you be planting transplants or direct-sowing seeds?
Will you be broadcasting seeds evenly across the surface, or placing them only in specific locations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-kill-your-grass&quot;&gt;How to kill your grass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;herbicide&quot;&gt;Herbicide&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one I’ve never tried.
The concept is pretty simple: get some glyphosate (aka RoundUp) and spray it evenly on all of the grass you want to be rid of.
Glyphosate works on contact and kills just about everything, but doesn’t continue to have an effect after the initial application.
After a few days, you should have a bunch of dead ground that you can proceed to plant with whatever else you want to put in.
This is probably the quickest and least labor-intensive method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of poison, though, so I’ve never given it a try.
In theory, this sort of glyphosate application done with proper safety precautions should be fairly safe and not present an ongoing danger.
But that theory depends a little too heavily on taking the pesticide industry at their word and ignoring the many times this sort of thing turned out terrible in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple other considerations that (I presume) are important to take into account with this method.
First, it doesn’t remove any vegetative matter, so all the dead grass and weeds and “thatch” will still be there on the surface.
Second, the glyphosate will not have any effect on the weed seed bank, so you must be prepared to act quickly to ensure that the weeds don’t get established before your replacement plantings do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this option feels like a last resort.
If I had a site so large or difficult that no other option was practicable, I’d consider it.
On a small urban lot, there are plenty of other choices, and many of them offer additional advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sod-removal&quot;&gt;Sod removal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/sod-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A roll of sod and the sod kicker used to cut it&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/sod-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/sod-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/sod-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/sod.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find (probably rent) either a manual or powered sod cutter.
These tools slice through the soil underneath the roots of the grass, and then you can roll the strips of sod up into big cylinders and remove them.
I did a bit of sod removal and replacement with a manual sod kicker, which I’ll write about at some point, but I haven’t used this method to clear a large area for replacement planting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to removing the grass, this method takes about half an inch of soil with it, which may or may not be desired depending on your situation.
By scraping off the entire top layer, you’ll also be removing a lot of the weed seed bank, which should dramatically decrease weed pressure (it won’t be effective on deep-rooted weeds like dandelions, though).
And you’ll be left with nice flat clear soil, which would be perfect if you’re going to be broadcasting seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important note: rolls of sod quickly become heavy and unwieldy.
It will be hard work moving them, and you’ll definitely want to have a plan for disposing of them.
You will generate more volume than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, rolling works best when it’s a dense layer of turf.
If your grass is sparser or dominated by weeds (as often is the case in full shade, for example), it may crumble rather than rolling neatly.
If that happens, the advantages of this method will largely be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alternative to removing the sod is to flip it over and leave it in place, smothering the grass and presenting the underside as the new surface.
Unless you already have a sod cutter, this seems like a lot of bother for not a lot of return.
In my experience, flipping sod does an imperfect job of killing the existing plant matter.
The weed seed bank will remain a threat, and you’ll still have a thick mat of vegetative matter that’s difficult to plant into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digging&quot;&gt;Digging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/digging-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Partially dug-up sod&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/digging.jpg 1800w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a shovel, dig up the grass, and remove it.
Pretty straightforward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about any digging tool can work, but the best is a standard square spade.
You want to be able to give it a good kick to quickly chop through the turf.
The flat edge is good for cutting sharp lines to outline and divide it into manageable pieces.
Then you can angle it shallowly to chop underneath the roots and lever out chunks of sod.
If you’re looking to remove more soil, that’s fine too, you can just dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring a wheelbarrow or other container with you to throw the material in as you go.
As with sod removal, expect to generate quite a large volume of removed dirt and plant matter, and realize that you will need to do something with all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flipping it over in place remains an alternative to removing it.
While it still has the downsides I mentioned in the sod section, what this method has to recommend it is extreme simplicity.
Digging and flipping can effectively prepare an area for planting without changing the height, requires no more than a shovel, and has no need for expensive or complicated disposal.
I used this method to prepare some of our side beds, and will discuss it more there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the shovel is a grub hoe (a tool similar to the average garden hoe except bigger, tougher, and meaner).
Rather than cutting out pieces of turf, with a grub hoe you move in a line, chopping out chunks of turf as you go.
Once you get into a rhythm, you can cut up a lot of area very quickly, much faster than with a shovel.
If you’re removing the material, you will still have to come back through with a shovel or your hands to pick up the pieces and chuck them in the wheelbarrow.
I used a grub hoe to remove the turf in a number of our early plantings, including the rain garden.
It’s a good compromise between efficiency and flexibility when working with areas of non-uniform vegetation and non-square shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover your grass with something opaque.
Black plastic sheeting is the standard choice, but old carpet, tarps, thick fabric, plywood sheets, or anything else that can hold up to the elements would also work fine.
Weight it down with rocks or boards or something so it doesn’t blow away.
Leave it on there long enough to kill everything from lack of sunlight, then take it off and you’re ready to plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty popular method in both small- and large-scale plantings.
I think the big benefit is that it is cheap, organic, and fairly light on labor.
It does take some time, obviously—at least a month, and a whole season would be ideal.
When the plastic comes off, all the vegetative matter and weed seeds are still going to be there, so don’t come unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used this method in a few small spots around the yard, but not for any major planting area.
The sheet mulching methods I’ll describe work on a similar principle but mitigate some of the disadvantages, so I find those to be more useful in my small urban site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solarizing&quot;&gt;Solarizing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-kill-your-grass/resized/solarization-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clear plastic sheeting laid over the boulevard grass&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks very similar to smothering, with one key difference.
Instead of using an opaque material like black plastic, you lay down clear plastic that lets sunlight through.
This creates a greenhouse effect, trapping heat under the plastic.
In warm temperatures and bright sunlight, it can get so hot under the plastic that it not only kills all the growing plants, but heats the top layer of soil to a temperature that kills weed seeds.
It does also damage the soil’s biodiversity by killing all microorganisms in the top couple inches, but if you take good care of the site afterwards, that will likely be able to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to smothering, this method is cheap and easy, and scales up or down well.
It’s a worthy alternative to smothering on sites where weed pressure is expected to be very high.
It’s also probably a bit faster than smothering, though with a less flexible timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried solarizing twice in our yard and failed both times.
I think my downfall is that this method, while promising, has more specific requirements than most of the other methods, and failing to get the conditions just right will render it completely ineffective.
If your temperatures don’t get hot enough under the plastic to kill the plants, you’ve instead created a nice warm moist tropical environment that most weeds will love.
Here’s the steps I think are crucial to success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep the edges of the plastic tight to the ground, perhaps by burying them in dirt.
If there are gaps, they will act like vents and allow too much airflow that will moderate the temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mow the area before laying plastic.
Lush plant growth can act like insulation, preventing heat from getting to the base of the plants to fully kill them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most important of all: you have to achieve maximum sun intensity for this to work.
Your area needs to have direct sunlight for at least several hours around midday, when the sun is straight overhead (approximately 10am-2pm).
And you need to have this in place for the sunniest part of the season (summer solstice).
Here in Minnesota, I’ve missed that window slightly and paid for it.
Even late July and August is too late for us.
It’s still hot and sunny weather, but the sun is too low in the sky by then and doesn’t radiate heat effectively enough to really get cooking.
For the best odds of success, I would aim to have my plastic down no later than the beginning of June, and plan to leave it until the end of July.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solarizing sounds like a very powerful method for certain site conditions.
If you think it’s the perfect thing for you, by all means go for it.
Just invest in a bit of planning to make sure you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheet mulching (also sometimes called “lasagna gardening”) combines several techniques into one all-inclusive method for preparing a site.
The basic idea is to layer material on top of your grass: first a biodegradable weed barrier to smother the existing vegetation, then a thick layer of organic material and mulch to hold it all down and provide fertility.
This is all left to decompose, and planting is done without any further disturbance of the soil.
Ideally, the sheet mulched area is given a few months to break down into nice fertile soil before planting.
However, it is also possible to plant directly into a freshly sheet-mulched area by punching holes through the weed barrier for transplants, or by topping the layers with soil or compost and sowing seeds into that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weed barrier is usually newspaper or cardboard (I much prefer cardboard).
There are many different “recipes” for the organic material layered on top.
Some people like to create many thin striated layers of material, while others just do a couple thick layers.
Usually some amount of compost is used, but there is a lot of flexibility in the other organic matter based on your preferences and what is easily available to you.
Straw, leaves, manure, sawdust, wood chips, shredded paper, and just about anything else you can think of are options.
You can also add soil amendments, or fertility boosters like used coffee grounds.
And you can add uncomposted kitchen scraps under the weed barrier, where they will break down along with everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        One of the benefits of sheet mulching is that you can add pretty much anything biodegradable underneath the weed barrier. Here is weeds, spent flowers, corn husks, plus coffee grounds I had collected from a local coffeeshop to boost decomposition.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By burying the former grass under a bunch of new material, the weed seed bank is kept away from the surface where it would germinate.
The dead vegetation will be broken down under the surface by worms and microorganisms, converted to organic matter that’s helpful to the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used sheet mulching to prepare about 500 sq. ft. for our vegetable garden and have had a very good outcome.
There are a couple things to get right for best results.
You want a nice thick layer of weed barrier.
If you’re using newspaper, use &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, like 8 sheets or more thick, with generous overlap between sections.
In areas where I went too thin, the more vigorous weeds (dandelions and quackgrass) sometimes managed to punch through the barrier.
I have switched to preferring cardboard to newspaper in most situations because one layer of sturdy cardboard does the job, and it’s much faster to put down than all that newspaper (dealing with newspaper on a windy day is a real nuisance too).
Second, whatever layers you put on top of the weed barrier should add up to a thick mulch.
Too little material and the weed barrier will degrade quickly and patient weeds underneath it will escape.
Third, this method works best on flat, even ground.
It’s possible to do it on slopes but you’ll need to make sure the mulch doesn’t move around too much and lose coverage.
The most weed trouble I had was near the edges of the garden where there’s an angle as the ground slopes down to the sidewalk.
My weed barrier was prone to tearing on that transition and letting weeds through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think sheet mulching comes out ahead of other methods in terms of results.
Done well, it can tame very rough conditions, and it effectively deals with the existing vegetation and weed seed bank.
It also rolls a bunch of soil improvement into the preparation step, something that you would have to do separately with most of the other methods.
It’s possible to do sheet mulching not only organically, but with also with local materials and materials almost exclusively reclaimed from the waste stream.
It can be done quickly or slowly, and can be done well in advance or right before planting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big downside to sheet mulching is that it’s a lot of work.
You’re looking at 3”-12” of organic material, which is a lot of stuff to haul in and spread over your site.
You may also find it difficult to source all the materials needed.
Living in the middle of a large metro area, I didn’t have easy access to straw or manure at a price that would have been cost-effective for the large amounts I needed.
You are also unlikely to have a large quantity of compost lying around if you want to sheet mulch a big area all at once, so you may have to purchase some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more consideration: sheet mulching will raise the height of the area considerably.
The freshly laid material may be as much as a foot thick, and the eventual settled height will probably be something like 3” above the former ground level.
This caused a bit of hassle for me where our garden meets the sidewalks.
Where the ground had previously been level with the sidewalk, it was now several inches higher and I had to install edging to keep it contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you’re willing to do a bit of work, sheet mulching is an excellent solution for sites that you want to be very well prepared.
For sites where soil fertility isn’t as important (for example, native plantings or unfussy perennials), or sites that are in okay condition to begin with, it might be overkill.
I’m glad I did a thorough sheet mulching for the vegetable garden, but for most other areas of our yard, I’ve developed a “lazy” variant that works well with much less investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lazy-sheet-mulching&quot;&gt;Lazy sheet mulching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a stripped-down variation of sheet mulching that uses the same principle but drastically simplifies the materials.
It’s quite simple.
Lay cardboard on top of the existing grass.
Top generously with wood chips.
Leave for a while to decompose, or punch holes in the carboard to plant immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method reduces the required inputs to two materials that are very easy for me to source.
Large sheets of cardboard can be gathered free from appliance stores, or my preference, bike shops.
Arborist wood chips are sometimes available free from municipal sites, and some arborists will also drop a load off at your house for free (since it saves them a disposal fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple recipe and the light weight of the materials mean I can cover a lot of area fairly rapidly.
It’s still more work than some of the other methods, but since the areas I’m working on would need mulch eventually anyhow, I come out ahead in the long run by having wood chips already in place to serve as mulch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like full sheet mulching, this offers a lot of flexibility in timing and scale.
A good thick cardboard and a deep layer of wood chips can suppress just about all weeds successfully, so the existing site conditions aren’t a concern.
As long as you like the wood chip aesthetic, the results look nice and need no further care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with full sheet mulching, the keys to success are a thick weed barrier and a thick layer of wood chips on top.
I’d aim for at least 2″-4″ of uncompacted wood chips, or even more if you’re feeling like it (the only time where too much wood chips could hurt is if you’re mulching around existing trees, whose roots still need to be able to breathe.
I don’t always plan ahead well enough for this, but the most pleasant timeline for sheet mulching is to mulch in late summer or fall, let it sit over winter, and plant the following spring.
The weed barrier will be mostly gone by then, the weeds will be dead, the wood chips will have settled into a nice stationary layer, and you’ll be able to very conveniently dig into soil that’s all ready for new plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method only works in places where wood chips are an acceptable final layer.
It wouldn’t be suitable for areas that are dug frequently, like vegetables or ornamental annuals.
It also doesn’t provide the immediate soil improvement of full sheet mulching, though over the course of several years, the wood chips will start to break down and provide a lot of benefits to the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method has become my go-to choice for most situations because for my yard, it presents the best path from grass to not-grass.
I’ve converted roughly 1500 sq. ft. of grass using this method, an amount that was achievable specifically because of the simplicity and efficiency of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;go-forth-and-kill-your-grass&quot;&gt;Go forth and kill your grass&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it: an arsenal of grass-killing techniques.
Which one is right for you depends on the specifics of your situation and your preferences.
Most importantly, pick the one that leads to you &lt;strong&gt;killing some grass&lt;/strong&gt;.
If your first attempt is small or imperfect, it’s still better than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this very moment you, yes you, have some patch of grass sitting around that you never use.
That grass is wasting your time, and it’s wasting the potential of a space that could be providing benefits you’ll never get out of grass.
Go kill that grass, and put something useful in its place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Garden" /><category term="How to" /><summary type="html">I hate lawns.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">(H.V.)AC</title><link href="https://house.youngram.net/air-conditioning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="(H.V.)AC" /><published>2021-05-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://house.youngram.net/air-conditioning</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://house.youngram.net/air-conditioning.html">&lt;p&gt;The other half-finished big-ticket project that came with the house (besides &lt;a href=&quot;/the-chimney.html&quot;&gt;the chimney&lt;/a&gt;) was central air conditioning.
The house had been fitted with supplies and a return for high-velocity air conditioning, and lines had been run for a condenser and air handler, but no units had been installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-velocity AC is a special system, manufactured almost exclusively by the Spacepak brand, that uses flexible supply lines that are much smaller than the ducts in your typical central air system.
It’s useful in old houses because it can be run through narrow existing spaces rather than a costly renovation or adding exposed ducts.
While this made it a sensible choice for our house, the downside was that it’s a somewhat specialized system that not every HVAC contractor deals in.
And yes, it’s very inconvenient that “high-velocity air conditioning” abbreviates to HVAC but that is already taken by the industry category of “heating, ventilation, &amp;amp; air conditioning”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central air conditioning is a big perk here in the land of humid summers, but a half-finished system wasn’t worth much unless it could become fully finished.
During the inspection phase of the sale, I called around to gather estimates on roughly how much it would cost to finish the installation.
This was a difficult task given that we didn’t own the house yet and I had limited information about how much needed to be done, and unsurprisingly I received a number of unhelpful answers from HVAC contractors.
However, Jason from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staffordhomeservice.com/&quot;&gt;Stafford Home Service&lt;/a&gt; not only called me back, but took the time to ask some questions about the project and ballparked it at $5,000.
I appreciated this, and it earned them some business down the road, since when it came time to tackle the project, they were the first ones I called for a quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got several other quotes in addition to Stafford’s.
One guy delivered a rambling monologue that apparently ended with a recommendation that we abandon the high velocity system and install some combination of ductwork and mini-splits.
I feel like that guy could have saved both of us some time by just saying “I don’t work with high velocity systems” the first time I contacted him.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://prontoheat.com/&quot;&gt;Pronto&lt;/a&gt; sent a salesman to do the quote and came back with an absurdly high price, something in the range of $15,000.
That one felt very much like they pulled a number straight from their &lt;cite&gt;Price Book for Suckers&lt;/cite&gt; and didn’t even bother factoring in the cost savings from the existing work.
Did I mention I hate gathering quotes?
I hate gathering quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stafford initially came back much higher than I had been expecting as well, but after some back and forth they came down substantially, to $7800.
This was more than I had been hoping to hear, but was still within the range that I had expected it might be.
One thing driving the higher price tag was that most of the contractors I spoke with urged me to install a more powerful system than the previous owners had seemingly planned for, which also mean installing more supply lines to distribute the additional air.
I suspect we could have gotten by with a less powerful unit, since the house is well insulated and we don’t cool it to 62℉ like a bunch of maniacs.
But, I wasn’t going to totally disregard professional advice, and it would be a shame to spend all this money installing a system only to have it underpowered and struggling to keep up with a Minnesota summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another planning visit and some more discussion, we came up with a plan to distribute the additional supplies: several more in the kitchen, one more in the largest bedroom on the second floor, and the rest in the attic, which was soon to be a finished space and would certainly be one of the warmer parts of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation happened over the course of about three days.
The first day involved a big crew of about five people, while the next two days were calmer with 2-3 people.
Jeremy was the leader of the crew and was a delight to work with (I’ve seen him about once a year since, for other projects and followups).
The crew did a great job of not making a mess and was good about consulting me before making important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wrapped up on July 20th, and then we proceeded to have an abnormally cool and cloudy summer and never needed to actually use air conditioning.
What a grand christening!
We did make good on our investment starting in the summer of 2018, which brought a number of prolonged heat waves.
The system works very well, runs quiet, and has no trouble cooling the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few small imperfections:
There are a couple large flexible ducts supplying some of the lines that I don’t love.
These might have been avoided if all the supplies had been placed during the initial installation, when some of the areas to run lines were more accessible.
One of the big ducts runs across the ceiling of the laundry/utility room in the basement, which is not a huge deal because it’s the laundry/utility room, but it does encroach on the headspace a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other runs around the edge of the attic.
This could have been a real nuisance, but it worked out okay.
We were already planning to build kneewalls on the slanted sides and could enclose it in those.
The part passing under the window will eventually be turned into shelves and a window seat, which is a good use for that space.
Still, it would have made life a little easier not to have to work these ducts into our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real complaint I had with the crew’s work was one spot I didn’t notice until after the job was done where they had routed a line in front of the attic’s small porthole window in a way it couldn’t be enclosed without blocking the window.
Frustratingly, the crew did a great job of communication in general and consulted me on a whole bunch of decisions where I was fine with what they wanted to do.
This was the one time that I wouldn’t have liked their plan, and of course it was the one thing they didn’t check with me on.
It was a good lesson to me that yes, I should check in frequently on work that’s happening and not feel too guilty about bothering the workers.
Luckily, this problem was pretty easily fixed.
By dropping the supply on the right side of the opening instead of the left, we could avoid the need to cross that part of the room entirely, and it still came out in a good part of the ceiling in the floor below.
I had our attic contractor relocate it when they were building the kneewalls, and it’s fine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dog-tax&quot;&gt;Dog Tax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal with this blog is to give you all the info, even when it’s a little dull.
Not every bit of owning a house is glamorous Instagram reveals, and I think it’s worth talking about the frumpy parts too.
However, I feel bad about subjecting you, my audience, to extensive posts on topics that do not inspire or excite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to propose a deal.
Whenever I write a post I deem sufficiently boring, I’ll reward you at the end with a cute dog photo, starring Rigby, our weird ornery lab/pit mix that we adopted in the same year as the house.
Hopefully this will be a worthy token of my appreciation for sticking it out through the less interesting moments of home improvement.
And look, if you didn’t actually read the whole thing and just scrolled straight down here to find it?
Well, that will be our little secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s your first installment of dog tax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain garden is one of my proudest landscaping achievements and probably the most unqualified success I’ve had.
I want to tell you all about it, but if you’re just here for the pretty pictures, I understand.
You can skip all the words and get straight to &lt;a href=&quot;#the-good-stuff&quot;&gt;the good stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-rain-garden&quot;&gt;Why a rain garden?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a rain garden is to capture runoff from a roof or paved area in a shallow depression where it can soak into the ground instead of reaching storm sewers or waterways.
Rain gardens are a great place for plants—the plants are watered for free, and their roots help create pathways for the water to seep into the soil.
Contaminants are filtered out as the water passes through the soil and subsoil, and it returns directly to the aquifer, as most rainfall did before we covered so much of the world in impervious surfaces and started funneling runoff into storm sewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm sewers reflect the era in which we sought to “conquer” nature, believing that if we just kept increasing the scale of our engineering, we could permanently corral and contain natural processes so that they would not not trouble us.
This idea has failed, both in the broader stage of human progress, and at the specific level of storm sewers.
Water that runs off of impervious surfaces carries all sorts of bad stuff—roof tar, fertilizer, oil and other chemicals washed off roadways—and often drains all this pollution directly into the nearest body of water (in our case, the mighty Mississippi).
Storm sewers are often old and crumbling infrastructure, and prone to being overloaded by major rainfalls, sometimes causing failures like the release of raw sewage into waterways (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surfrider.org/coastal-blog/entry/tijuana-river-the-largest-sewage-spill-weve-ever-seen&quot;&gt;lookin’ at you, Tijuana&lt;/a&gt;).
Waterways flooded by excess runoff also often suffer major erosion and a host of related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain gardens just make a lot of sense.
They reflect the approach that has risen to replace the failed mastery of nature: the idea of working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; nature rather than &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; it, of respecting natural processes and fitting them into our anthropocentric world.
They also represent a decentralized form of civic engineering that offers the resilience and autonomy centralized systems often fail to provide.
Rain gardens are a way to have our cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had rain gardens on the mind when we bought our house, so I evaluated the suitability of the property pretty early on in my planning process.
It was a good match: we had no existing runoff management, and some of the downspouts were causing drainage issues that ought to be addressed.
With our large yard and nothing in it but grass, there was plenty of space to accommodate a rain garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best resource I found for rain garden design and installation was &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/files/rain-garden-manual.pdf&quot;&gt;this guide from Blue Thumb&lt;/a&gt;.
It offers a lot of useful information, including a lot of very specific practical advice that is invaluable if you’re going to be doing the installation yourself.
Another good resource (that didn’t exist when I did this project) is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwsr.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/2020-06/Planting%20for%20Pollinators_updated_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;Lawn to Legumes planting guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant lists are also a great way to get started without a lot of prior knowledge.
I can’t find the plant list I used the most when making my design—it was especially nice because it was a selection of relatively easy-to-find plants, and it listed not only basic information about the plants but also where in the rain garden (basin, sides, top) they would be best suited.
If I were doing the project now, I think I would start with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwsr.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/2019-08/Rain%20Garden%20template_acc.pdf&quot;&gt;Lawns to Legumes rain garden template&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://extension.umn.edu/landscape-design/rain-gardens#choose-plants-1778663&quot;&gt;UMN Extension rain garden guide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xerces.org/publications/plant-lists&quot;&gt;Xerces Society plant lists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other good way to determine the best location for specific plants is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/&quot;&gt;Prairie Moon’s excellent plant information&lt;/a&gt;.
They list moisture preferences for each plant, which is a good approximation of where they’d like to be in a rain garden.
Plants listed as “wet” and “medium-wet” will likely be happy in the bottom of the basin.
“Dry” or “medium-dry” plants need to be fully outside of the basin.
Plants in the medium zone will probably be happy on the sides of the basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plant-selection&quot;&gt;Plant selection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plant selection for the rain garden and immediate surroundings is entirely species that are native to Minnesota.
I didn’t set out with that as the goal—some people adhere to a very strict natives-only policy just for purity’s sake, but that never particularly called to me.
It just turned out that native plants provided the best functional fit for my goals in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native plants are a very good bet to do well in our climate because they literally evolved to grow here.
They provide the highest-quality food and habitat for native insects because those insects evolved in parallel to depend on these plants.
Many native plants need very little maintenance, and once established, can outcompete weeds.
Native plants often have very deep root systems that help with water infiltration and allow them to tolerate major dry spells without supplemental watering.
There is also a very good selection of native plants that will tolerate alternating wet and dry conditions, perfect for planting inside the basin of the rain garden, which may be underwater for some hours after a heavy rain but also may dry out completely after several weeks of no rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/prairie-roots-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing depicting a side-by-side comparison of the root systems of different prairie plants&quot; srcset=&quot;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I evaluated candidates for planting in this area, native plants kept rising to the top of the list because they had so much to offer.
Many plants exist that could fill the space and look nice, but with those traits being equal, why would I not choose the option that comes with so many additional benefits?
The common downsides of natives (that they take a while to get established and that they don’t always lend themselves to a carefully manicured garden aesthetic) were also not concerns for me, and I have access to several vendors of high-quality and ethically-sourced native plant seedlings, so there wasn’t much reason for me to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had settled on about 90% of the plant selection and it was all natives, it seemed like I might as well lean into it and declare the area 100% natives, so that’s what I did.
Everything between the existing non-native blue spruce to the west and the non-native peach tree I planted to the east is, to the best of my knowledge, a plant native to Minnesota.
The only sections that were a little trickier to design with this constraint were the low groundcovers (along the path and the fenceline) and the areas of full shade (particularly in the house’s shadow and underneath the spruce).
Native plants for these conditions do exist, but it took a bit more research to uncover good candidates and sometimes took more effort to source seedlings than it did for more common plants in the other areas.
Still, I’m glad I decided to set myself the challenge.
It’s been fun to puzzle out how to get everything I want within the palette of native plants, and it has kept the design for this area nice and focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals for plants in this area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aid infiltration of runoff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/&quot;&gt;food, shelter, water, and habitat&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of wildlife&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Partially screen the view from the sidewalk into the dining room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide beautiful views from the two sets of windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flowers blooming throughout the entire growing season, so people and pollinators will always have something to enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots of different colors, because colors are pretty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Require few to no inputs (water, mulch, fertilizer) once established&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Require little weeding or other maintenance once established&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing trees and shrubs along the north edge seemed like a good plan, so I started there.
These could provide a screen and beautiful views, and putting them on the north side would leave plenty of sunny space for other plants.
I came up with a short list by consulting lists of native woody plants that enjoy a fair amount of moisture, cross referenced with lists of plants that provide benefits to birds and pollinators.
Then I sketched a ton of different layouts, evaluating each one for how well it provided screening and views, and if it left room for a good rainwater basin and lots of sun for wildflowers.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        More or less the winning concept. A few of the plant selections changed, but the structure and layout remained the same.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on a large serviceberry shrub/tree and a couple medium shrubs, highbush cranberry and chokeberry.
All three of these have attractive flowers, nice fall color, and berries that are popular with birds and (to varying degrees) edible for humans as well.
Elderberry almost made the cut, but we had acquired a dog who likes to eat a lot of things she finds outside, and there are some reports of elderberry toxicity to pets—not a particularly grave danger, but I decided I’d be happier if I just didn’t have to worry about how many unripe berries the dog had eaten off a bush in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb for siting rain gardens is they should be at least 10 feet away from the foundation.
That plus the placement of the woody plants defined the approximate shape of the basin.
I made sure to extend it far enough to be within reach of both of the downspouts that would be feeding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step was filling it in with wildflowers and native grasses.
Starting with the list of candidates I had built up from my resources, I started slotting them in based on sun an moisture preferences and plant height.
Advice for designing with native plants is to plant them in “drifts” of multiples for the best visual effect, so I did mostly groups of 3-4 per species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rain garden plan called for a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of different species.
In no way was this necessary; you can make a perfectly beautiful and functional rain garden with a much smaller palette.
But I had gotten really excited about native plants during all my research and wanted to fit in as many as I could.
One of the advantages of all that variety was that I didn’t have to plan too carefully around bloom times.
With all the different flowers, there are always a few things blooming at any given time, giving pollinators a nice steady supply of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a first draft to rough things in, I did a second draft of the plan with colored pencils to mark flower colors.
This helped me fine-tune the placements so I could have a nice mix of colors throughout the space and not have all the yellows clumped together or anything like that.
Plus, this made my plan look really fancy like I knew what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot tip: don’t forget the grasses.
They’re not as showy as the flowers, but they’re pretty too and will add to the overall effect.
Plus, they’re a crucial part of the prairie ecosystem, so if you want your prairie flowers to be happy, let them hang out with their grass buds.
I planned some grasses but not as many as I should have, in part because I didn’t take my own advice, and in part because it was harder to source a variety of grasses than it was to source wildflowers.
In particular, grasses and sedges that like wet feet are not as readily available, so the basin was a little lacking in grass.
In the years following I’ve started some additional grasses and sedges from seed to help fill in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain garden was going in right by &lt;a href=&quot;/basement-egress.html&quot;&gt;the egress window&lt;/a&gt;, so it definitely needed to wait until that was finished.
Luckily the window got done early in spring, so we were ready to get started on the garden as soon as the ground thawed, which ended up not happening until late April thanks to an endless winter.
I transferred the paper plan to the actual site by outlining the basin with marking paint and sticking stakes in the ground to mark the trees and shrubs.
This gave me a chance to fine-tune the design and make sure it harmonized with the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

        Never mind the fence construction debris. You can see the sump pump outlet sadly spitting out into the grass in the bottom corner, where one of the channels would eventually go.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the initial planting was from starts rather than seeds.
Native seeds can be difficult to germinate and grow, so starts were easily worth the small extra expense, especially given the number of different varieties I was planting.
Most of the plants came from the massive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.friendsschoolplantsale.com/&quot;&gt;Friends School Plant Sale&lt;/a&gt;.
This sale was a huge boon for my project.
Their native plant selection is excellent, the plants are good quality, and their prices are significantly better than what I would find anywhere at retail.
Plus, they had gone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.friendsschoolplantsale.com/blog/post/neonics&quot;&gt;fully neonictinoid-free&lt;/a&gt; by then, a very important consideration given that this garden was meant to attract and benefit pollinators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I was going to go big at the sale, I developed a carrying system with a convertible hand truck so I could fit everything I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and Katherine helped out for installation day.
Residential-scale rain gardens are a project easily accomplished with simple hand tools.
We removed the sod with shovels (I also used my grub hoe to make things move faster), then hand dug the basin to the desired depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        We found this old rusty edging buried several inches below the top of the soil. How long ago did someone have a garden here, and how did it get so buried?
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was aiming for about 3-4” below grade at the bottom of the basin.
Stretching a string from one edge to the other let me measure down with a ruler to check our depth.
Combined with a bubble level, this also allowed me to make sure the edges of the basin matched in height.
I kept the outside edge a tiny bit lower so that if the basin overflows, the water will flow out with the grade rather than backing up towards the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planting moved fast with all the helping hands.
Using the paper plan, I set seedlings out where they were to be planted, and everyone else followed behind digging them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have finished up by mulching around everything, but it had been a hectic spring and I hadn’t acquired mulch yet, so I just watered everything in and left it as bare dirt for the moment.
It’s recommended to use double-shredded mulch, which mats together and resists floating up when the basin fills with water.
I bought some mulch made from recycled lumber because I liked the sound of it, but honestly the shredding wasn’t very good and I would have been better off going with the standard weird dyed stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Basin mulched with shredded wood. I'd add regular arborist wood chips along the upper areas later.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a week or so to acquire and put down the mulch, which unfortunately provided an opportunity for a bunch of weed seeds to germinate and cause me trouble throughout the year.
A better plan: have the materials on hand and ready to distribute immediately after digging the garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;downspout-channels&quot;&gt;Downspout channels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure that water from the downspouts was conveyed effectively to the basin of the rain garden, but I didn’t really want to add giant downspout extensions.
I decided to dig a couple channels and line them with rocks in a sort of creek bed aesthetic.
After sifting through all the dirt from the &lt;a href=&quot;/basement-egress.html&quot;&gt;egress window&lt;/a&gt; and the dirt we had just removed from the rain garden itself, I had quite a good collection of fist-sized river rocks on hand.
These worked perfectly and it was lovely to be able to turn a waste product into an asset.
I saved myself the time and money of disposal and I didn’t need to buy imported rocks.
Closed loop, baby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging the channels mostly just involved making sure they maintained a steady downhill grade so there was nowhere that water would pool.
I had some landscape fabric I had scavenged from somebody’s alley, and I decided to line the bottom of the channels with that, held down by landscaping staples.
I figured this would discourage weed incursion and help keep the soil in place.
Landscape fabric also significantly reduces water infiltration, which is a negative trait when used in plantings but was beneficial in channels where I’d prefer the water to run off anyways.
I could have lined them with black plastic to completely prevent water infiltration, but I didn’t have any black plastic on hand, and am not very worried about a small amount of water soaking in, as long as most of it runs off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mounded a little soil along the edges to define the channel, filled them in with rocks, and we were in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-first-try-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The first version of the drainage channel&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-first-try-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-first-try-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-first-try-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/channel-first-try.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the appearance of these channels a lot and they worked well enough in the first year.
However, a few design flaws became apparent that I wanted to improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had topped off the large rocks with a bunch of smaller gravel-size rocks (also dug up from our yard).
These kind of ruined the attractive look of the rock, and also seemed to encourage sediment buildup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I had tried to make the channels meander a bit instead of taking a straight path, for aesthetic reasons.
Since they are only about six feet long, these curves ended up looking a little forced and one of the larger bends was causing water backups and erosion.
Better to give it a straight path and let the edges gently undulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I needed better separation on the edges.
Having no physical barrier meant a lot of dirt and woodchips was being kicked into the channels, which would presumably eventually clog them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2020 I pulled all the rocks out and re-dug the channels.
This time I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homedepot.com/p/ProFlex-24-ft-x-4-in-Bronze-Aluminum-Landscape-Edging-Project-Kit-4-6-ft-pieces-1806BZ-24C/202969881&quot;&gt;aluminum landscape edging&lt;/a&gt; to define the edges.
I don’t know why Home Depot doesn’t carry this stuff in stores.
It’s great: easy to install, easy to bend to shape, stays put, looks nice, and should last for a long time.
It’s a bit pricier than plastic edging, but for this small a job that wasn’t much of a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-re-dug-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unfinished channel with edging and landscape fabric installed&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/channel-re-dug.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put Katherine in charge of replacing the river rocks in an aesthetically pleasing configuration, and she took the job seriously.
The final step was to build &lt;a href=&quot;/garden-bridges.html&quot;&gt;some lil’ bridges&lt;/a&gt; where the path crosses the channels, to protect the edging and cut down on contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/channel-finished-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished channel filled with rocks and small footbridge&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/channel-finished.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these changes made, the channels have worked perfectly and look great.
I love how they fit into the landscape, and the fact that all the rocks came from this land gives them a special extra connection to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisions&quot;&gt;Revisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final plan I drew up on paper has stood up quite well to implementation.
I made a few adjustments based on plant availability and moved a few things around slightly at planting time, but for the most part I was able to follow the design and it has turned out very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the plants have succeeded.
The Rattlesnake Master and a couple of the unusual milkweeds didn’t do well and seem to be gone now.
The Blazing Star suffered because it didn’t come with a tag to stick in the soil and I foolishly didn’t add anything at planting, so I lost track of where it was planted. Blazing Star leaves look pretty similar to grass, so I think I may have pulled it out during a weeding session without anything to warn me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only needed to change a couple plants that haven’t worked in their original spots.
The Wild Golden Glow was altogether too happy with its spot in full sun with lots of moisture and grew to about 9 feet before flopping over and causing trouble for the plants around it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relocated it to a shadier corner by the spruce tree and it seems to be growing much more reasonably now.
I replaced it with Sneezeweed, which may also prove to be a mistake if it turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://projectpalermo.com/2020/06/14/orc-week-6-cursing-the-queen-and-hailing-the-halo/&quot;&gt;like it did for Hauslermo&lt;/a&gt;.
This year I plan to relocate the Royal Catchfly, which seems a little too small and dainty to hold its own with the burly prairie plants around it.
I plan to replace it with New England Aster and another try at Blazing Star, marked properly this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I could have planted with tighter spacing.
I drew up the plans using recommended spacings from Prairie Moon, but I could have tucked everything a little bit closer if I wanted a garden that felt “full” a few years earlier.
That said, this would have required more plants and thus increased costs, so I’m not sure I would have done so anyways.
In subsequent years I’ve been tucking more plants into available spaces as I discover additional species that pique my interest or have success starting less-common plants from seed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After observing the garden’s performance in major rain events over the first two years, I realized some parts of the basin needed to be deeper.
The wide portion of the basin had originally been dug deeper than the narrow portion, which caused water to flow to the deepest part instead of being distributed evenly.
I carefully dug around the existing plants to bring the other parts of the basin to an equal depth—definitely more of a nuisance than doing it prior to planting, but it worked.
The basin can now hold significantly more total water, and more plants get access to the moisture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mistake I made was one that I ought to have been wise enough to avoid, given how much time permaculture spends on the concept of succession.
When planning the spacing and light tolerance for plants around the trees and shrubs, I plotted the mature size of the plants.
But the baby woody plants will take 5+ years to reach that size, and I should have thought through the sunnier and more open conditions that will exist until they do.
Luckily, most of the plants I picked out for shade in those areas (Dwarf Trout Lily, Sweet Joe Pye) seem to be handling the extra sun gracefully.
I’ve filled in some of the extra space with some easy sun-loving plants like Goldenrod that will be gradually phased out as they become shaded.
A garden changes over time, and a good plan should take that into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much happens in the first year of a native wildflower garden.
Not only do most plants not flower in their first year, but many of them seem to just sit there without even putting on much foliage.
Be patient, they’re working on a good root system and will get moving once they’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watered carefully for the first month or so, but we had pretty good rain that summer so after that I mostly just left them alone and only watered after prolonged dry spells.
I spent a considerable amount of time weeding that summer (I don’t have a good estimate of how much exactly).
Part of this was my own doing: I had left the area unmulched for too long after planting and then didn’t get it mulched super thick after that.
This gave weeds (particularly some nuisance grasses) a bit of a foothold and caused me to spend the summer beating them back.
I think I likely would have needed to invest some time in weeding regardless, but I probably could have reduced it by quite a lot by nailing the installation a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year two was much more encouraging.
The plants put out much more vigorous growth, and most of them flowered.
It was clearly not completely established yet, but I could start to envision what it will look like at maturity.
It was beautiful throughout the growing season and attracted lots of insects.&lt;/p&gt;

        We also had nice spring blooms in 2019 from Wild Geranium and Columbine.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a fairly wet summer, so I don’t think I did any supplemental watering other than for some new transplants I added.
Even if the summer had been drier, I would have done a pretty minimal amount.
The plants had good root systems by now, a layer of mulch to keep moisture in the soil, and plenty of rain water coming from the downspouts.
I also did very little weeding in the second year, probably in the area of 10 total hours.
This was a nice change from the more involved work of year one, I think thanks to a combination of my thorough job from the previous year and the native plants starting to outcompete weeds more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year three felt like the garden had fully arrived.
The woody plants still have a lot of growing left to do, but most of the forbs are at a mature size.
Some of the more aggressive spreaders (like Common Milkweed and Obedient Plant) have already expanded considerably, while many of the others will spread more slowly over time.
So far, almost everything is cohabiting happily.
Time will tell if some of the aggressive plants will start to swamp the others and need to be curtailed, or if everything will find an equilibrium (obviously I’m hoping for the latter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t add any supplemental water to the established plants in the third year, and barring some freak climactic event, I don’t plan to in any subsequent years.
I also spent almost no time weeding: one short session in spring and one in fall, and other than that just a few minutes pulling weeds here and there when I was already poking around the garden doing other things.
I don’t think I spent more than 5 hours total weeding the rain garden in 2020, and as far as I know it ended the year with almost no weeds growing.
This is very exciting!
A low maintenance burden was one of my goals for this area and it is exceeding expectations.
I probably spent another 1-2 hours on needed maintenance—mostly cutting back dead plant stems—and another hour doing the needed relocation of Wild Golden Glow.
Beyond that, the rest of the time that went into the rain garden was purely optional stuff like adding some new plants or just poking around watching the pollinators at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t had too many pest problems.
The Cup Plants have had a few infestations of red aphids (apparently a fairly common thing), but they don’t seem to be an actual problem so I’ve left them alone and assumed nature will sort it out eventually.
The rabbits leave most of the native plants alone.
They heavily browsed one particular bunch of Switchgrass while leaving all the other grasses alone, and it seems like they might occasionally nibble on certain baby plants.
Someone (I blame the squirrels) digs up Prairie Clover every time I try to plant it (does it have good-smelling roots or something?).
As I add transplants at a slower pace I sometimes protect them with chicken wire cages to improve my odds, but everything that went in the first year was not protected and largely did fine.
The biggest problem the rabbits have caused in the rain garden is with the woody plants, which they will eat in winter when other food is scarce.
They chewed up both the Pagoda Dogwood and the Chokeberry pretty badly in the first winter, and I’m sure they would have attacked the Serviceberry as well if I had given them the chance.
At this point, I put up fencing around all of the woodies for winter, and will continue to do so until they’re big enough to not get targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain garden is also excelling at its titular job of capturing runoff.
It’s getting runoff from 3/4 of the roof, plus the sump pump outlet, and while the basin is a little smaller than the size recommended to capture 100% of runoff, it’s been handling it like a champ.
The basin has filled up a few times during major rain events.
To my knowledge, it has only overflowed once, and it did so away from the house, as planned.
Usually it drains within a few hours, with the maximum time so far being somewhere over half a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of water (thousands of gallons, by now) diverted from the storm sewers.
I adore the multi-functional nature of rain gardens.
Not only are we doing a civic good by mitigating runoff, but that runoff is converted to beautiful plant life that brings joy to humans and provides for the needs of a vast number of pollinators and other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-stuff&quot;&gt;The good stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate all the rain garden does for water and wildlife, but it’s also worth underscoring just how pretty it is.
A steady diet for pollinators also means there’s something pretty in bloom at just about any time of the year.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favorite-plants&quot;&gt;Favorite plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like all the plants in the rain garden.
There are certain ones, though, that I especially enjoy for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cardinal-flower-lobelia-cardinalis&quot;&gt;Cardinal Flower (Lobelia cardinalis)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/cardinal-flower-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cardinal Flower in bloom&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/cardinal-flower-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/cardinal-flower-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/cardinal-flower-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/cardinal-flower.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the royalty of the rain garden.
Look at that brilliant red!
One of my goals for the yard was to attract hummingbirds, and this plant is one of the top recommendations, for obvious reasons.
It has worked, too: I’ve spotted several hummingbirds visiting the flowers.
No successful photographs yet, because those suckers move &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard that some people have trouble growing this one, but it has done very well for me.
It’s planted in the part of the basin that receives the most moisture and seems to be very happy with that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obedient-plant-physostegia-virginiana&quot;&gt;Obedient Plant (Physostegia virginiana)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/obedient-plant-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bee approaching flowers of an Obedient Plant&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/obedient-plant-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/obedient-plant-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/obedient-plant-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/obedient-plant.jpg 2385w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obedient Plant is just the right amount of strange.
The flowers are closely packed on spikes and the blooms progress upward over time, giving it a sort of pyramidal appearance.
Bumblebees seem especially fond of this plant and are often visiting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obedient Plant gets its name because you can adjust the angle of the flowers and they will stay where you put them.
Ironically, it is not an obedient plant and is well-known to be an aggressive spreader.
I’ve seen it doing this for me and it has already expanded well beyond where I planted it.
So far the spreading has not been a problem, but I will keep monitoring it to make sure it’s not getting into any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partridge-pea-chamaecrista-fasciculata&quot;&gt;Partridge Pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/partridge-pea-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Partridge Pea growing along the edge of the sidewalk&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/partridge-pea.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plant doesn’t seem to get much publicity, which is strange considering how delightful it is.
I found it because it was listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plants.usda.gov&quot;&gt;USDA Plants Database&lt;/a&gt; as a native plant with the highest level of nitrogen fixation ability.
It’s an annual but self-seeds so effectively that it might as well be a perennial.
It’s got a bushy, mounded habit about 1’-2’ high.
After letting it spread for a few years, we have big drifts of it along the fenceline, where it has been very effective at outcompeting weeds.
It does spread some each year, but it’s not hard to rip up some seedlings if you want to keep it in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to grow and blooms right away—a treat in a newly-established native plant garden where all the perennials will take their time to get going.
The profuse yellow flowers are very pretty and bloom for an extended period of time.
And pollinators &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; this plant.
I see all sorts of bees, wasps, and flies jostling each other as they enjoy the buffet.
When I walk past the partidge pea in late summer, there’s so much activity that it sounds like the entire bush is buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any other flower I grow comes even close to the amount of pollinator interest these generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grays-sedge-carex-grayi&quot;&gt;Gray’s Sedge (Carex grayi)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t think a grasslike plant could be exciting?
Think again as you gaze upon the madness of Gray’s Sedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/grays-sedge-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gray's Sedge with seed pods&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/grays-sedge-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/grays-sedge-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/grays-sedge-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/grays-sedge.jpg 1800w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, those are this sedge’s seed pods.
Why it decided to make it look like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_star_%28weapon%29&quot;&gt;morning star&lt;/a&gt;, I do not know.
But it’s a delightfully weird sight, and the sedge itself has grown very happily in part shade at the bottom of the basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other sedges with fun seed heads (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/carex-muskingumensis-palm-sedge-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;palm sedge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/carex-vulpinoidea-brown-fox-sedge-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;fox sedge&lt;/a&gt;), but Gray’s Sedge is a total standout and well worth picking up if you can find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wild-geranium-geranium-maculatum&quot;&gt;Wild Geranium (Geranium maculatum)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/wild-geranium-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowering Wild Geranium&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/wild-geranium-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/wild-geranium-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/wild-geranium-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/wild-geranium.jpg 2181w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several early-blooming spring flowers planted in the rain garden, as food sources are especially helpful for hungry pollinators at that time of year.
Wild Geranium always strikes me as the most cheerful of the early bloomers.
The light blue-purple flowers are a welcome pop of color in the spring, and look as nice in shade as in sun.
It has grown very well for me without any special treatment and bloomed profusely in the second year.
Wild Geranium is also found in many of the wooded state parks around Minnesota, so now that I recognize it I’ve enjoyed spotting it on spring hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spikenard-aralia-racemosa&quot;&gt;Spikenard (Aralia racemosa)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/spikenard-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Berries on a Spikenard plant&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/spikenard-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/spikenard-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/resized/spikenard-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-rain-garden/spikenard.jpg 2400w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spikenard is a weird one.
I picked it out because I had been reading about Wild Sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicalis), which has roots sometimes used as a root beer substitute, and that led me to its relative Spikenard (Aralisa racemosa).
In mid-summer Spikenard looks like a rounded bush, about 2-3 feet tall and wide, but it’s an herbaceous plant and dies back to the ground in winter.
I have it growing in fairly dry full shade at the end of the garden and it seems happy as can be.
It has started putting out bountiful clusters of small berries.
There isn’t a lot of information on if the berries are edible to humans, but it seems like they are probably fine.
I’ve tried them and the flavor is pretty nice!
They might get a little insipid if eaten in large quantities, but they make a good nibble.
In theory the roots of Spikenard can also be used in a beverage, though I don’t know if I will ever go to the trouble of trying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serviceberry&quot;&gt;Serviceberry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect we will like our serviceberry a lot, since pretty much everyone loves serviceberries.
It started as a very small seedling, though, so it’s still a fairly small plant and is not yet flowering or producing fruit.
Mostly I just wanted to take a moment to tell you about how utterly confusing the taxonomy is as soon as you try to determine what actual plant constitutes a “serviceberry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees that it’s a plant in the &lt;em&gt;Amelanchier&lt;/em&gt; genus, but beyond that, all bets are off.
There’s &lt;em&gt;A. laevis&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes known as Allegheny serviceberry.
There’s &lt;em&gt;A. alnifolia&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes known as Saskatoon berry.
&lt;em&gt;A. arborea&lt;/em&gt; is downy serviceberry.
&lt;em&gt;A. canadensis&lt;/em&gt; is Canada serviceberry, or sometimes shadblow, but shadblow can also refer to other species in the family.
One of the most popular serviceberries sold in nurseries, ‘Autumn Brilliance’, is &lt;em&gt;Amelanchier × grandiflora&lt;/em&gt;, a hybrid cross between &lt;em&gt;A. arborea&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. laevis&lt;/em&gt;.
“Juneberry” is sometimes used to specifically refer to &lt;em&gt;A. alnifolia&lt;/em&gt;, but at other times is used generically to refer to just about any of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s &lt;em&gt;A. lamarckii&lt;/em&gt;, about which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=a403&quot;&gt;apparently no one can agree&lt;/a&gt;.
It might be a hybrid cross between &lt;em&gt;A. canadensis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. laevis&lt;/em&gt;. Or it could be a cross between &lt;em&gt;A. arborea&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. laevis&lt;/em&gt;, which would make it the same as &lt;em&gt;A. x grandiflora&lt;/em&gt;.
Or it might not be a cross at all but rather it’s own species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, many nurseries will simply sell you a “serviceberry” without providing species information.
And of those that do provide species information, it may just be incorrect.
So who knows what you’re getting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://oikostreecrops.com/products/fruit-plants-organically-grown/serviceberry-saskatoon-amelanchier-plants/keweenaw-allegheny-serviceberry/&quot;&gt;a selection of a wild type&lt;/a&gt; from OIKOS, purveyors of unusual crops.
They bill it as &lt;em&gt;Amelanchier laevis-canadensis&lt;/em&gt;.
I assume they’re doing this just to mess with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/general-plan-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our lot with themed areas marked&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/general-plan.png 1456w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an excellent starting point for the design, but I still had to fill in a lot of details and figure out what we were actually going to put in, and where.
I already extolled the virtues of &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/edible-forest-gardens-volume-ii/&quot;&gt;Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; in the previous post, so I’ll spare you more of that, but suffice it to say that I learned a lot about the following planning steps from it as well, from broad concepts down to specific advice on drafting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-map-of-the-territory&quot;&gt;A map of the territory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shown you an overview map of our lot that I used for high-level planning, but let’s back up and talk about how I got that map in the first place.
We didn’t have any documents to use as a starting point, so it was up to me to come up with a decently accurate map of the yard and existing features.
Here’s my working document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-sketch-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very rough sketch of our lot layout&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-sketch-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-sketch-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-sketch-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/overview-map-sketch.jpg 1917w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched out the house and yard and then spent a while walking around outside measuring every component you see marked on there.
For the longer segments, I marked out about 40 feet with masking tape on a spool of rope I had found abandoned in the garage and used that with a little stake to hold one end.
This let me measure large distances like the sides of the lot fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my annotated sketch in hand, I was ready to get out graph paper and start putting together an accurately-scaled drawing of the lot.
You can see I didn’t measure every dimension of every feature, but rather just enough of the dimensions that the other ones can be deduced with the existing information.
Were our lot bigger or more complicated, I might have needed to use fancier techniques like triangulation to accurately locate some features, but on my map that never felt necessary.
Most features were easily placed with right angles, and I only needed it to be accurate within a couple feet anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A finished map of our whole lot layout&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/overview-map-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/overview-map.jpg 1375w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final map was drawn on 10x10 graph paper.
I have another version drawn in Sketchup, which is the one you see in the previous post, but I didn’t end up using that version much during the planning process.
The graph paper version was easier to refer back to, as I could easily count out measurements of an area I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-of-the-trade&quot;&gt;Tools of the trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for doing a lot of mapping, I assembled some tools to help.
These weren’t all necessary, but they did make the job a bit faster and more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Graph paper&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I got two types, 10 squares per inch and 4 squares per inch. The 10x10 is easiest to do math with, and matches up with the common engineer's scale of 1:10.
      It's a good size for larger maps but was a little too small for doing finer designs on specific areas, like mapping out exact plant locations.
      The 4x4 graph paper was a much better scale for those drawings.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Tracing paper&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Once I had a map drawn, I could quickly trace the boundaries onto tracing paper to make copies.
      This was handy when I wanted to try out different potential layouts or iterate several times on a design.
      There are other ways I could have dealt with this, so the tracing paper was not a necessity, but it did come in handy a few times.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KIDVJE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Circle drawing template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I stumbled on this by chance but it turned out to be one of the most useful tools I picked up.
      This particular template has a wide range of circle sizes that were perfect for drawing trees, bushes, and forbs.
      It's much easier and faster to draw small circles this way than with a compass, and much neater than trying to draw circles freehand.
      There are other templates with a variety of architectural shapes, but circles was all I ever needed.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Compass&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Purchased to make circles, but the circle drawing template picked up most of the work so I didn't use this much.
      Still a useful tool to have around, and has a few uses in addition to circles, such as quickly transferring distances.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Engineer's triangular scale&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Like an ordinary Imperial ruler, but with inches broken into fractions of 10 rather than 12.
      Used with 1:10 graph paper, you can make measurements that translate to feet with no conversion required.
      While it seemed like a great idea, I didn't end up using this very much.
      If I weren't primarily working on graph paper, or if our site were bigger and had fewer right angles, I might have needed it more often.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQSV7E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Clutch pencil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Not a necessary purchase, but a nice complement to mechanical pencils.
      Has a wider expressive range, such as drawing thicker lines, or shading areas.
      Sturdy and will last me forever.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lay-of-the-land&quot;&gt;The lay of the land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevation changes are typically an important part of site design.
The contours of a site can affect water drainage, microclimates, ease of access, and so on.
I won’t be discussing this much, for the simple reason that our lot doesn’t have any elevation changes.
It’s graded completely flat and is level with the sidewalk, so we don’t even have the small front yard hill that many South Minneapolis lots do.
For the most part, this was fine, as it made my job easier.
I thought a few times about adding mounds or hills to provide some variety, but there was nowhere in the yard that seemed like it would particularly benefit from that, and since the drainage on our site is generally fine, I was hesitant to make any changes that would throw things out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to consider early in the design process is hardscaping.
In our case, this was also fairly easy.
There is a small patio behind the house, and if we ever decide to add a larger patio, it will go in that same area.
I don’t have any plans to change the location of the other sidewalks, and other than slightly decreasing the size of the driveway when we put in the fence, none of that is changing either.
The area a potential patio might extend to is staying grass for now, so there wasn’t a concern about installing permanent plantings when they might turn out to be in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plants&quot;&gt;Plants…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant selection was probably the most time-consuming (and most fun) part of the process.
I didn’t have much plant knowledge coming into this, so I really dove headfirst into the subject.
Starting with themed areas helped a lot, as the different sections of the yard naturally lent themselves to different kinds of plants.
The food area got vegetables and other edibles, the wildlife area got native plants, and the back of the lot got a permaculture food forest palette.
Focusing on these areas one at a time gave me a way to direct my research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the resources I found most useful in this were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tobyhemenway.com/book/gaias-garden/&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Gaia's Garden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Offers some good starter lists of permaculture favorites, and in-depth profiles of a few specific plants the detail how they might be best put to use.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/edible-forest-gardens-volume-ii/&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The back of the book is a huge set of appendices with fabulous plant lists for a permaculture focus. Would that every resource was this thorough.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/perennial-vegetables-from-artichoke-to-zuiki-taro-a-gardeners-guide-to-over-100-delicious-easy-to-grow-edibles/oclc/636660344?loc=&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Perennial Vegetables&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A guide to edible perennial plants, a subject I was specifically interested in. Not a perfect book but a good companion piece to the others.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/birdscaping-in-the-midwest-a-guide-to-gardening-with-native-plants-to-attract-birds/oclc/80180291?loc=&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Birdscaping in the Midwest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A thorough and informative guide to attracting all sorts of birds. Excellent plant lists, second only to &lt;cite&gt;Edible Forest Gardens&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/attracting-butterflies-hummingbirds-to-your-backyard-watch-your-garden-come-alive-with-beauty-on-the-wing/oclc/893647163?loc=&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Attracting Butterflies &amp;amp; Hummingbirds to Your Backyard&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Just like it says, a guide to creating plants and habitat for hummingbirds and butterflies. These were two types of wildlife I was specifically interested in, so it was a great fit.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Seed catalogs&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Some of the catalogs seed companies put out offer a lot of good information on the plants they sell. Fedco has very good paper catalogs for both trees and vegetables. [Prairie Moon](https://www.prairiemoon.com/)'s online and paper catalogs are excellent reference sources for native plants in our region.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Plant lists&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;There are lots of sample plant lists for native plants floating around. I collected a variety including some from Blue Thumb, Xerces, and UMN's Bee Lab. If I were starting today my first stop would be the resources in the [Lawns to Legumes program guide](https://bwsr.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/2020-06/Planting%20for%20Pollinators_updated_2020.pdf). The plant lists and sample plans are high quality and easy to use.&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plants.usda.gov&quot;&gt;USDA Plants Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This tool isn't the easiest to use, but it contains a ton of information. I used it to check if a plant was considered native to the state, to find scientific names for plants, and to help untangle the taxonomy of plants with confusing classifications (lookin' at you, &quot;serviceberry&quot;). Some plants also have more detailed fact sheets or plant guides, which can offer detailed information on growing characteristics (though these are often aimed towards agriculture or forestry). They also have a ton of searchable plant characteristics that I feel like I have only scratched the surface of. For example, I figured out how to search for MN natives with &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;high&quot; nitrogen fixing capabilities and got several useful plant suggestions from that.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        A glimpse into my master plant list.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plant research mania hit a peak with the creation of the “master list” I used to track potential plants and their attributes.
Many of the fields were cribbed from the extensive and detailed charts in &lt;cite&gt;Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two&lt;/cite&gt;.
Any plant I came across in research that sounded interesting was added to the list, and if it entered serious consideration, I’d fill out as many of the fields as I could find information for.
This gave me a quick reference for design characteristics like size, sun, and moisture preferences.
It also helped me track which of the traits I cared most about were met by each plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing plants, the primary criteria for me is: what functions does this plant serve?
Ideally, everything we grow should serve multiple purposes (in the permaculture world, this is called “stacking functions”).
For example, a large serviceberry shrub on the north side of our lot can provide: attractive spring flowers and beautiful fall foliage; a partial screen from the sidewalk; early season food for pollinators; tasty berries for birds and humans; perching spots and cover for birds; habitat for a variety of insects; a deep root system that sequesters carbon, improves the soil, and allows for water penetration; and leaves that filter dust and pollutants.
While it might sound very complicated to look at plants in this multi-faceted way, I felt that it actually made the job easier by narrowing my scope to selections of plants that have a lot to offer.
Notably, I have been able to almost entirely ignore the vast world of decorative nursery perennials, because those plants are often bred solely for appearance and in my garden a single function is not enough to warrant consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of functions dovetailed perfectly with the considerations I had &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-plan-a-garden-part-one.html&quot;&gt;previously mapped out&lt;/a&gt; with zones and sectors, as finer-grained details within the general themes.
For example, when picking plants for the northeast corner, the general theme dictated that they contribute to a woodland feel and four-season beauty.
From sectors, I knew that they should be attractive from the public sidewalk as well as our picture window, that they should be able to withstand the strong winds that enter at that corner, and that they should provide a windbreak to protect the rest of the yard.
From zones, I knew that they should be relatively self-sufficient because I wouldn’t be dragging a hose up there all that often to water them, and I wouldn’t be passing through every day to deal with weeds or other maintenance.
Red-twig dogwood meets all of those criteria perfectly, plus is a native plant with excellent wildlife value, so it got the nod in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        The master list eventually generated several offshoots, like this plant sourcing list.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like now would be a good time to point out that you certainly do not need to go this deep to do a successful garden design.
This sort of highly detailed data-heavy process suits my personality, and besides, I was very excited about the whole project.
But many people are perfectly successful using a much less rigorous process, so don’t be intimidated by my spreadsheet version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://crazywalls.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;the crazy wall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-where-to-put-them&quot;&gt;…and where to put them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding on the exact placement of plants, there a number of other questions to consider besides meeting the desired functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How big will the plant be at maturity?
What is its habit (i.e. shape) and will that be a good fit for where it is?
How much sun does it like and will it receive the right amount (both right now, and once the plantings are fully established)?
Will it create the right amount of sun at maturity for surrounding plants?
What sort of root system does it have and will that coexist with other plants nearby?
Does it spread or stay in one place, and is that what you want it to do?
Will it receive the right amount of moisture?
Is the plant hardy in your zone, or if it’s borderline, will it receive extra protection?
Will the plant be happy with the soil pH?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For spacing, I largely adhered to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/t/153438/Dense-Wide-Spacing-Food-Forests#1214206&quot;&gt;“crowns touching” rule&lt;/a&gt;.
In hindsight now that we’ve had a few years of growth, I think I made the right decision on tree spacing but I could have planted many of the shrubs and forbs more densely.
As &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/t/153438/Dense-Wide-Spacing-Food-Forests#1203185&quot;&gt;this commenter&lt;/a&gt; notes, “most people put their trees too close together, but then don’t plant enough support species”.
I’ve been slowly filling in my original plantings with additional understory plants as I realize there’s space for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing the designs was a highly iterative process.
I worked primarily with the trees and shrubs in most sections, as those are the most permanent and most structural plants.
For each section, I put together a short list of possible plants using the resources listed above, then sketched out different placements and combinations to see what worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain garden was one of the most complicated areas, reflected in the number of different concepts I considered for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;fade&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had a base map, I could use tracing paper to quickly create copies of a map to sketch different ideas on.
For the back of the lot, which had a lot of flexibility, I wanted to quickly visualize many different layouts and combinations of different plant sizes.
I cut out a bunch of circles of different sizes representing standard, semi-dwarf, and dwarf fruit trees, as well as small and large shrubs.
I could push these around on the map as I thought through how to best make use of that space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;fade&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the side of the house, I was also interested in the vertical dimension of the planting, as we wanted to partially screen our windows but not create an impenetrable wall.
Once I had a layout that looked good from the “top-down” perspective, I drew a scaled side view to help me imagine what it would look like from the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to making sure the plans looked good on paper, I vetted them on the ground itself to make sure they felt good there as well.
I used stakes to mark the center of major elements and spray paint to mark the outlines of trees, bushes, or other structural elements.
This helped me visualize the final result and gave me a chance to walk out potential borders and pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the “bones” of the landscape decided, I filled in the designs with the “forbs” (non-woody plants) I wanted.
This process was similar to the trees and shrubs, though often easier because there is a lot more flexibility in placement of smaller plants.
What plants went into the design depended on what plants I could source, so this part involved iterations of looking at plant lists from local vendors, adjusting the design, rechecking the plant lists, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some areas didn’t get detailed schematics of every plant ahead of time, but rather a rough plan of plant selections and quantities that I’d finalize at planting time.
And of course the iterative design process continued after planting, as I would realize I had more room to fill, or would need to replace a plant that wasn’t doing well, or would find a new exciting plant and need to figure out where to fit it in.
I consider the maps living documents, and try to keep them updated as things change (though my track record on that has been spotty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time--materials&quot;&gt;Time &amp;amp; Materials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any idea how much time went into planning, as it was conducted in bits and pieces over many months.
I will say, though, that I spent a very substantial amount of time on it—many tens of hours.
Some of that was because I was learning a ton about plants and ecosystems and wildlife and landscape management as I went.
Some of it was because I was very enthusiastic and went into way more depth than was strictly necessary.
Still, planning a design of this magnitude is a definite commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

I had done a bit of gardening at our rentals over the years, but always at a fairly small scale.
I knew I wanted to go much bigger with my ambitions, but I didn’t have any experience in landscape design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our yard is quite big for the inner city.
It’s a full double lot (just under a quarter acre) and our house has a fairly small footprint, so there’s plenty of space left over.
Other than a couple huge trees, the yard was entirely turfgrass when we moved in, and I knew I wanted to kill most of that.
This meant that I had a blank slate to work with, and while great in a lot of ways, that also meant that I didn’t have anything to guide my decisions or limit my options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear that I needed help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have gone with a traditional landscape design firm, but I hate to imagine how much they would have charged me for a set of fancy full-color plans.
Besides, this wouldn’t have been a good fit for how I wanted to manage the garden.
I wanted to handle most of the installation and maintenance myself, and I knew the design would need to change over time.
This meant I needed a strong understanding of the rationale behind the design and how all the pieces fit together—not something I was likely to get out of having a complete set of plans dropped in my lap.
I also wanted a garden that was uniquely tailored to our needs, not just the same ten plants that the landscaper uses in every yard they design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid a garden consultant to do a site visit and draw up an informal set of layouts.
While I didn’t end up using most of her designs, the process did get me started thinking about how to determine how to use a space, and it gave me a sense of the possibilities available to us.
I could start to see the shape of the thing I needed to do, I just needed a lot more practical information to actually be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;observe-and-interact&quot;&gt;Observe and Interact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best decisions I made in the planning process was forced upon me.
We finished a rocky closing process for our house at the end of April, and the timesuck of buying a house, moving, and being first-time homeowners meant that I had very little time to plan or prepare as planting season rolled around in May.
This necessarily limited how much I could expect to achieve in the first year, so I planted &lt;a href=&quot;/the-first-year-garden.html&quot;&gt;a modest vegetable garden&lt;/a&gt; and accepted that my bigger ambitions would need to wait a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was good, because major site planning decisions really should not be made until one has been able to observe conditions throughout a growing season.
I probably wouldn’t have followed this advice well if I had a few more months of lead time before spring, but I’m glad I didn’t have that choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending the first year observing allowed me to see how the site changed over time: what kind of runoff came from the house during rainstorms, where water pooled during wet periods, which areas got the most and least sun, where the grass grew well and where it didn’t, and so on.
It gave me time to take detailed measurements, draw maps, and conduct soil tests.
And it gave me time to learn a lot more, to roll ideas around in my head, to sketch out possibilities while looking at the site, and to get outside and pace out distances on the ground when I needed to see it in situ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-educated&quot;&gt;Getting educated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I figured out in the process of reading about gardening stuff was that the permaculture philosophy greatly appealed to me.
What is permaculture?
There are many answers to that question, few of them short, but I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.permaculturenews.org/what-is-permaculture/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; pretty well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Permaculture (the word, coined by Bill Mollison, is a portmanteau of permanent agriculture and permanent culture) is the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems… [It] is a system of assembling conceptual, material, and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. The philosophy behind permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless action; of looking at systems in all their functions, rather than asking only one yield of them; and allowing systems to demonstrate their own evolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a certain set of gardening practices (food forests, hugelkultur, comfrey) that have become associated with permaculture, some of which I do find appealing, but for me those were not as much of a draw as the whole-design nature of the idea.
Many other garden ideologies like organic gardening or square foot gardening tend to be centered around one specific concept plus a loose constellation of practices compatible with the core idea.
While many of them have useful advice to offer, I don’t find them compelling as an organizing principle for everything.
Permaculture, in being primarily a design philosophy, credibly promises guidance on the entirety of the system—not only how one manages a garden, but how a garden can fit into your life and the surrounding world.
It provides not only tools for thinking about design, but tools for thinking about the act of designing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entry point for permaculture was Toby Hemenway’s &lt;i&gt;Gaia’s Garden&lt;/i&gt;.
It’s a lovely book that provides a very accessible overview of the concepts that drive permaculture design.
It’s not the final word on the subject, but it was a great place to learn the concepts and terminology, and to gather ideas about how I could apply these concepts in my own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permaculture also gave me a descriptive term for exploring and discovering useful information.
Because it is aligned with many of the things I wanted out of the garden (beyond-organic, low-input, ecological), I could peruse permaculture sources as a starting point and learn about ideas and techniques that were likely to appeal to me.
It would be fair to point out that some permaculturists are pretty wacky and not all of their ideas are good.
I’m pretty skilled at sifting through information of varying quality, so this was not a big deal for me, but a more credulous person could be led astray by bad advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major breakthrough in my planning education was probably the most valuable book purchase I’ve ever made: &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/edible-forest-gardens-volume-ii/&quot;&gt;Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: there is a Volume One, which provides a conceptual background on permaculture and temperate climate forest gardens in particular.
It’s a perfectly nice book, but not essential if you’ve picked up the gist from other sources.
All the meat is in Volume Two, which focuses on practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Edible Forest Gardens, Volume Two&lt;/cite&gt; is a stellar permacultural resource, with extensive plant lists and tables.
But it’s also an excellent guide to the design process in general.
It offers an extremely thorough design program that you can follow to the letter or simply pluck out the parts that appeal to you, and it covers the whole spectrum from very broad exercises like defining the vision for your site, to very specific advice like the best way to plant a tree.
I referred to this book a ton throughout every step of my process.
It was particularly valuable early on, as I was struggling to figure out where to begin.
The design exercises gave me tools to move from ideas to action.
Let’s take a look at some of the interesting ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-begin&quot;&gt;Let’s begin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early part of the planning process was turning the dreams I had floating around in my head into concrete goals, large and small:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A large garden plot dedicated to food production&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fruit trees and berry bushes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food and habitat for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As much of a fully-functioning natural ecosystem as possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Features to draw charismatic wildlife such as hummingbirds and butterflies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beauty in all four seasons, both for our enjoyment and for passersby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Areas for relaxing outside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexible space for gatherings, activities, dog and child playtime, etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low maintenance burden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A rain garden, probably&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lilac bushes (they’re my favorite flower)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had some site-specific constraints and issues to address.
Most of these were revealed during the observation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The thin strip between the garage and alley was full of weeds and in bad condition, being an especially tough site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Much of the lawn was lumpy and uneven.
Some areas had pretty good grass, but others were very weedy and/or patchy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the yard is level with the public sidewalk, it feels very weird if there isn’t something to delineate the border.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The back of the lot, near the alley, was neglected and in terrible condition.
The soil was so compacted that nothing would grow there until it was improved.
Drainage was also very poor and it would remain very wet for a long time after rains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lists provided a reference point I could return to at any time during the later stages of planning.
When considering a potential design, it’s often hard to decide “is this a good plan?”
It can be much easier to answer when reframed as “does this plan meet the criteria I laid out as important to me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zones&quot;&gt;Zones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common permaculture planning tool is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Zones&quot;&gt;“zones”&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with plant hardiness zones, which are a different thing entirely).
Zones are a framework for thinking about how location affects the manner and frequency of our interactions with a space, and planning our land use to be compatible with these factors.
Things that we use often, or that require frequent attention, should be located in areas that are easy to access and that we frequently visit.
Areas that are further from the house or harder to access will be visited less often, and are harder to supply with resources like water or compost.
We should use these areas for things that require fewer inputs and can take care of themselves without frequent weeding or other maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical 5-zone framework is oriented towards larger tracts of land, like rural homesteads, and so many of the specifics are not as relevant to urban areas.
A city lot is unlikely to have zones 3 through 5 (farming, forage, and wilderness) located within its boundaries.
However, the general concepts are still a useful tool for planning an urban space.
Our yard very much has areas that are easier or harder to access, and visited more or less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/zones-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our lot with zones marked out&quot; srcset=&quot;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

        Our lot mapped with micro-scale zone designations.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back of the lot, for example, is far enough from the house that most hoses don’t reach.
This means it’s a nuisance to water it, and therefore it will not be watered very often.
We also don’t pass through that area on the way to or from anywhere else, and we don’t spend time in that area to relax or work.
When planning what to do with it, I looked specifically for things that were resilient and largely self-sufficient.
While that area was a potential site for the vegetable garden in terms of size and sun, I knew relatively high-maintenance vegetables were something that should go in a closer zone if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strip between the alley and garage is even further out, zone-wise.
Not only is it far from the house, it’s completely out of sight from almost everywhere in the house and yard.
Out of sight, out of mind!
Therefore, my top criteria for any use of that site was that it had to succeed under severe neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest zone in our lot is probably the area right outside the back door.
This is very close to the kitchen, and we pass through multiple times per day on the way to the garage, driveway, or out for walks.
This would be an ideal site for herbs and other plants that need frequent access or attention, but unfortunately this area is also heavily shaded by the white pines, so most options would not do well there.
I would compromise on these things and put them in a location that wasn’t quite as frequently visited but provided much better growing conditions.
Zones aren’t the final word, but rather a useful tool to be used as part of a toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sectors&quot;&gt;Sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another planning tool described in &lt;em&gt;Edible Forest Gardens&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.oregonstate.education/permaculture/chapter/sectors/&quot;&gt;“sectors”&lt;/a&gt; and “flows”.
While these are commonly described in terms of directional forces, I think the real power of the technique lies in giving shape and location to various invisible aspects of a site.
When we create maps, they tend to identify tangible things: here’s the dimensions of the house, here’s the path, here’s some trees, here’s a hill.
But where does the sun shine in winter?
Which views are desirable or undesirable?
What enters the site from neighboring areas—wildlife, odors, light, seeds, pollution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/sectors-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our lot with sectors marked out&quot; srcset=&quot;

        A sector-ish analysis applied to our lot.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking in terms of sectors helped me distill a bunch of observations about our site into a concise and useful format that could be used alongside other maps to inform my decisions.
Some key takeaways for us were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several windows on the first floor of the house look out onto sections of the yard, and we would like those to be nice views of some sort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our north-facing windows are close to the street, and with only empty space between the house and the sidewalk, it made our dining room feel exposed to people walking past.
It would be nice to have something to partially screen the view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The wind can really rip across parts of the lot.
The worst seems to be north winds traveling across the front yard.
These are not only unpleasant, but prove destructive at times, knocking over crops and causing other minor damage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The alley is not a charming view and would do well to be screened. The garage is also not a great view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We only have one immediate next-door neighbor, who is quiet and easy to get along with.
We don’t need major screening in that direction, though something to slow down the entry of weed seeds might be nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The house gets limited sun in the winter, so we should not do anything to further limit that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Due to the corner lot, we have a lot of interface with the public sidewalks and roads.
This gives our yard a lot of potential to be appreciated from the outside as well as from the inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sun-surveys&quot;&gt;Sun surveys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably do a more in-depth post on sun surveys at some point.
Since sunlight is one of the most important factors to plants’ success, it’s very valuable to know how much sun an area receives when you are deciding what to plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My early sun surveying was done informally by simply paying attention and mentally noting where sun and shade fell throughout the 2017 growing season.
Later, I would do the process more formally by systematically photographing the yard over the course of the day to document the sun and shade.
This latter method took more work and planning, but offers much more exact detail, which is useful in more precise planning.
The informal method was good enough for my initial needs of delineating the yard into general areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/sun-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our lot with sun exposure marked&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/sun-480.png 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/sun-800.png 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/sun-1200.png 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/sun.png 1563w&quot; /&gt;
  
    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        A very rough estimate of sun and shade on our lot. I didn't use this during planning, it's just for your edification.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun data was vital to deciding where to place the vegetable garden.
In order to get the best production out of many types of vegetables, I needed to make sure it was located in “full sun” (6+ hours of sun per day).
I would also use sun information heavily when planning other plantings, like the rain garden.
The area selected for that has a mixture of different sun types, so when designing I selected a variety of different natives and made sure to locate each plant somewhere with conditions that suited it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun is important to humans as well as plants.
I considered sun conditions carefully when selecting the areas that would be maintained for leisure.
Katherine especially likes to bask in the hot sun like a lizard, so I made sure to accommodate her needs with several spots for relaxing that receive sun at different times of the day.
Since it’s sometimes more comfortable to be in the shade, I was also careful to leave several spots that allow for that.
Thanks to the placement of the house and some large trees, these spots change roles over the course of the day, so an area that was sunny in the morning will be shaded by afternoon, while another area that was shaded in the morning is now in sun.
This gives us a lot of flexibility and encourages us to be outside as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heres-the-plan&quot;&gt;Here’s the plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through these exercises, in combination with a lot of time to simply look at our yard and think about it, helped me through my decision paralysis.
With all this information distilled into discrete lists of attributes, I could start piecing combinations together like a logic puzzle.
Some areas had specific problems that needed solving, and so should host something that solved that problem.
Some of the features I wanted to add had specific placement needs, and so those would get first priority on suitable sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that given the size of our yard and the wide variety of features I wanted, the easiest way to develop a sensible plan would be to break the yard up into several broad areas, each with their own theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/general-plan-1200.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of our lot with themed areas marked&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/general-plan-480.png 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/general-plan-800.png 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/resized/general-plan-1200.png 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/how-to-plan-a-garden/general-plan.png 1456w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southwest corner got a “food production” theme and would host the vegetable garden.
Sub-themes for this area were “beneficial insects”, because insects are useful to food plots for pollination and pest control, and “visually interesting”, because it is situated at the front of the lot and should be pleasant for us to look at from the porch and passersby to look at from the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The north side of the house got a “wildlife” theme. There is a fair amount of space there, but we were never likely to spend much time there ourselves, so it made sense to set it aside for the benefit of insects and birds.
I knew this theme would lend itself well to low-maintenance plantings, which was a definite plus for this area (despite being close to the house, it’s not particularly close to either door, and it’s a bit hard to reach with a hose).
Other considerations for this area were that we wanted beautiful views out of our windows, and we wanted some tall plantings along the sidewalk to partially screen the house.
Both of these would fit well with wildlife plantings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East of the house got a “people” theme.
This is where we spend the most time hanging out in the yard, and where we host gatherings, play games, etc.
This was the area most likely to remain partially turfgrass, though I planned to add some borders to provide beauty and partial screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The northeast corner got a “wild” theme.
This area was furthest from the house and any sidewalk and thus needed things that could mostly fend for themselves.
Because of its position, it could afford to be a bit unruly without inconveniencing anyone.
It also had some serious soil quality problems that made it unsuitable for more delicate plants, lacking a major intervention.
Since this space wasn’t in high demand for anything else, I knew it would be an excellent place for some of the bigger features I wanted to add, like fruit trees.
The extended timeline of establishing a “food forest” would work well here.
Trees would eventually fill in most of the space, but while they were small I could grow other things around them to hold off the weeds and improve the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West of the house got a “beauty” theme.
In particular, I wanted some part of the yard to have excellent winter interest, and with this area bordering the sidewalk and visible from our front picture window, it seemed like a good place.
Had I been working with a smaller yard, I could have folded the “beauty” theme into the other themes with some clever plant placement, but because I had plenty of space to work with, I felt I was able to give it a dedicated space.
As I got into more detail on what exactly I would plant, this theme morphed into “woodland beauty”.
This blended well with the bordering “wildlife” area, extending the wildlife zone further and giving the whole side yard a naturalistic landscaping feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south side of the house just had a “flex” theme, which meant I wasn’t sure what we’d do with it and would keep our options open for now.
The &lt;a href=&quot;/the-first-year-garden.html&quot;&gt;first-year garden&lt;/a&gt; was there, so the conversion of that into prairie would augment the pollinator needs of the neighboring food production area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southeast corner got a loose “dog &amp;amp; birds” theme, which was more a descriptive label based on its current use.
I didn’t have a strong vision for how to use that area and figuring it out was not a high priority.
This part of the yard is dominated by the two giant white pines, so they drove a lot of the use.
The grass wasn’t doing well in their heavy shade, so I’d get rid of that and plant something more appropriate.
We’d have some wood chips and hopefully get the dog to do most of her bathroom business over there.
The trees already attracted a lot of bird activity, so maybe we’d add some feeders or birdhouses to augment that.
This is also the best shade from hot midday sun, so we’d leave some area for us to use on days where we needed some relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-just-getting-started&quot;&gt;We’re just getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This macro-level plan seems so straightforward in hindsight, but reaching this point felt like the hardest part of the process.
With my themed areas as the guiding document, the rest of the design seemed to flow naturally out of it.
That’s not to say I didn’t have a ton of work still ahead of me, though.
I had a lot of research and designing left to do, which we’ll cover in part two.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Garden" /><category term="How to" /><summary type="html">With our new house, I was very excited to start planning our garden and landscaping, but to be honest also very intimidated.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/basement-egress.html&quot;&gt;basement egress window installation&lt;/a&gt; left us with a giant pile of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/dirt-pile-in-progress-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of a very large pile of dirt&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/dirt-pile-in-progress.jpg 1574w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowly redistributed this to other places around the yard as I added garden beds, but some of the the subsoil they had dug up was heavy clay.
Hard to work within garden beds, not great for plants, and if left on the surface, prone to drying into useless rock-hard chunks.
I started separating out this clay soil and setting it aside as I moved all the other stuff, so as I reached the end of the pile I was left with probably about 20 gallons of clay soil with no real purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/clay-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of a pile of heavy clay soil&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I contemplated what to do with all this clay, one particular idea floated to the top and stayed there.
In season 2 of the delightful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07237wd&quot;&gt;Big Dreams, Small Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, Monty Don helps the mildly eccentric Frankie renovate her country cottage garden.
Frankie pursues her garden dream of a mud head against Monty’s direct advice.
It’s a completely mad idea and she absolutely nails it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the mud head to Katherine and she, much like Monty, expressed extreme skepticism about the idea.
Well guess what?
Frankie and I both know that sometimes you just gotta believe in yourself and your weird mud head, and that anyways you can just wait until the doubters aren’t around and build it then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to do some research and found a dearth of information on mud head construction methods.
Apparently there are not a lot of people in the world building mud heads.
I can’t imagine why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems likely that mud sculpture is an ancient art, but any information about traditional methods must be buried in anthropological journals or something.
There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heligan.com/explore/estate/woodland&quot;&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; famous mud sculptures that get some press, but most of these are large and seem to incorporate something like a mesh structure to be fitted with moss plugs.
My mud head was going to be much smaller and less sophisticated, plus situated in full sun without regular watering.
This meant moss was likely out as a covering and I was on my own design-wise.
I decided not to overthink it and que será, será.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-go&quot;&gt;Let’s go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction was pretty simple.
The dirt had been under a tarp and was at a good level of moistness.
I hauled it to the spot in a five-gallon bucket, one load at a time.
First I built a base platform and “watered it in”, trying to get rid of air pockets for a solid, stable foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/base-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Base of the mud sculpture&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/base.jpg 1600w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once most of it was there, I shaped it into a rough head and started molding the densest clumps of clay into the features.
I shaped it on a gentle slant and tried to design the face so that there were no wells where water would collect.
Once the features were roughed in, it was just a matter of refining the shape and prominence of the features and adding details until it looked the way I wanted (suitably dramatic).
I gotta say, it turned out better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide&quot; data-splide=&quot;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;splide__track&quot;&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;splide__list&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the head finished, I smoothed the surface as much as I could and left it to bake in the hot sun, hoping that would harden up the outer shell.
I had intentionally chosen a period of time in midsummer with a dry, sunny forecast to tip the odds in my favor.
Katherine told me it was weird and then didn’t bring it up again.
Her loss if she’s not going to appreciate my work of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;long-term-performance&quot;&gt;Long-term performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial plan worked well and the head firmed up nicely.
I also covered it with a tarp during rain for the first few weeks, hoping if I gave it more time it would become more resilient to weathering.
It developed a few cracks as it dried, which I tried to patch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/cracks-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cracks developing on the mud head&quot; srcset=&quot;
https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/cracks-480.jpg 480w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/cracks-800.jpg 800w, https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/resized/cracks-1200.jpg 1200w, 
 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-mud-head/cracks.jpg 1600w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as I had suspected, unfired clay soil just doesn’t have the strength to hold up to Midwest weather.
The head did okay for a while after I exposed it to the elements, but within months it was showing definite signs of degrading.
The nose fell off at some point (shoutout to Egypt’s sphinx, ze gets it).
By the end of the summer, the head had degraded to the point of not being recognizable.
I left it where it was, to become a mound of soil slowly melding back into the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect the secret to making a mud head maintain its integrity would be to cover it in living plant matter.
Roots would stabilize the soil structure and leaves would shield it from battering rain.
Moss is a likely candidate but didn’t seem likely to do well in my site.
The most promising idea I came up with was Elfin Thyme, a cultivar of thyme that is especially low growing with small leaves.
If Elfin Thyme could establish successfully, it ought to spread to eventually form a thick, low mat of vegetation hugging the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspected that given the small size of my mud head (about 1.5 feet in each dimension), the features would likely be drowned out by a cover of vegetation.
It would also have taken a fair amount of effort, and I wasn’t quite invested enough in this idea to commit to that.
Thus, my decision to let this be an ephemeral masterpiece, soon to exist only in memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to set a goal in the future of establishing a permanent mud head, I think I’d aim to make it substantially larger (maybe 5 feet in each dimension), reinforce it with mesh or straw cob, and plant it immediately with plugs of thyme.
Katherine better watch her back.
You never know when I’ll get a burst of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

However, we closed on the house at the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that.
The timeline meant that I wasn’t going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, this was a blessing in disguise for me.
It forced me to temper my ambitions for the first year, and that gave me a whole growing season to observe and learn about the condition of the land.
Thus, when I did start making more permanent decisions I did so well-informed.
In the moment, though, it meant I had to get creative about what I could scrap together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already present was a small corner near the porch that was absolutely packed with hostas, and one small raised bed, oddly nestled against a juniper.
Not much to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-circle-garden&quot;&gt;The circle garden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one more feature in the yard that could have been a problem but instead I saw as an opportunity.
The previous residents had kept an enormous above-ground pool in the side yard for quite a few years.
The pool was gone when we moved in, but in its place was a large circular patch of totally bare dirt.
It was a good size for a garden, and planting it with vegetables was going to be a lot more fun than letting the weeds plant it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a halfhearted job of double-digging the circle to loosen up the soil.
In the process I discovered that some sections of the space had about 8” of decent soil before hitting a layer of compacted rocks and rubble—this would be a recurring theme in the yard.
It quickly became clear that digging into this compacted layer and sifting out the rocks would take far too much time and effort.
This was a temporary site, not a permanent one, so it didn’t need to be perfect.
I dug down as far as the good soil and left the stuff below it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was already past planting time, so as soon as it was ready I started putting things in the ground.
I had some seeds from previous years, and I bought some starts at the Friends Plant Sale and a couple neighborhood plant sales.
I also acquired a few plants from neighbors giving away extras, though one of those I would come to regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planks salvaged from &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/06/20/the-garage.html&quot;&gt;the garage&lt;/a&gt; formed makeshift paths, and I got a bale of straw from a garden center for mulch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/circle-garden-july-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The garden in early July&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/circle-garden-july.jpg 1600w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbits started snipping things the moment I planted.
Luckily I was cruising the free section on Nextdoor pretty heavily around this time and had acquired some chicken wire and t-posts, so that made a makeshift fence.
At some point I got some landscape staples and used those to hold down the bottom of the fence, and that arrangement provided sufficient protection throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-bed&quot;&gt;Bonus bed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the circle garden, the small raised bed was available for use, so I planted it with tomatoes and a few flowers and other leftovers.
This bed didn’t have any critter protection, but thankfully the rabbits around here have never shown any interest in tomato plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/raised-bed-june-800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The raised bed in late June&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juniper right next to the bed, however, got in the way of maintenance and harvesting.
I never figured out what the logic was in this placement.
The boards were also rotting and coming apart, so I didn’t expect this bed to exist beyond this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pretty-good-results&quot;&gt;Pretty good results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the limited amount of site preparation and the numerous imperfections in my process, I feel like I got as good of results as I could have hoped for.
There was remarkably little weed pressure–I think the pool must have been in place for so long that the weed seeds underneath it had rotted or lost viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/circle-garden-peas-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peas and marigolds in the circle garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the vegetables grew well, considering the soil hadn’t been amended or improved in any way.
I did buy some liquid fertilizer that I applied to the tomatoes and flowers a couple times.
It’s from a local company that grinds up invasive carp into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twomikes.net/?page_id=37&quot;&gt;a nutrient-rich fish juice&lt;/a&gt;.
What a great use for an unwanted species!
As you might imagine, it smells a bit fishy when applied, but that smell is gone by the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a nice crop of tomatoes, which is good because they are a top garden priority around here.
The greens were also good, with more arugula than I could harvest and a stellar performance from the “Amish Deer Tongue” lettuce, which has earned itself a permanent place in my planting lineup.
Beans and peas are always a good bet, and we had a nice mix of herbs too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say there weren’t failures.
I planted quite a few herb and flower seeds that never germinated.
Many of these were from packets I’d been holding on to for years, so it’s likely a lot of the seeds were just too old.
I tried to grow a tomato plant from saved seed, but lacking any way to start it indoors, I just direct-seeded in mid-May and it barely reached maturity before the weather got too cold.
We also impulse-purchased some Prairie Smoke plants without any specific plan on what to do with them.
Well, those are fairly reticent native perennials that take several years to establish before flowering, so not a great choice for a garden-in-transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made one more error that seemed small at the time but would come back to haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sunchoke-mistake&quot;&gt;The sunchoke mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunchokes, also known as Jerusalem Artichokes, are a perennial relative of the sunflower with tasty edible tubers.
They are also often described as an aggressive spreader, to be treated with care.
I took these warnings too lightly and paid for it.
When someone on Nextdoor offered free baby sunchokes dug from their yard, I biked over and grabbed a handful of starts, which I plopped in the middle of the circle garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake #1: &lt;em&gt;Right&lt;/em&gt; in the middle of the garden.
My thinking at the time was that they were taller so they could be flanked by shorter plants without blocking views or sun.
In retrospect, what I actually did was provide them with a ton of open soil to colonize and no barriers to keep them contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistake #2: I suspect these sunchokes were a wild type.
There are cultivars that produce bigger tubers and spread less vigorously, but these were probably the undomesticated variety.
I’ve since reined in my use of free plants from neighbors, in large part because of this sort of loss of control over the finer details of what gets planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunchokes grew okay through the season, though they “lodged” (i.e. fell over) after enduring some moderate winds.
The first disappointment came when I dug them at the end of the season and discovered that they had created almost no edible tubers.
Their root systems contained a few tubers too tiny to be practical and a ton of rhizomes (long-distance horizontal roots), and if that sounds like foreshadowing it’s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real bad news arrived the following spring (2018), when hundreds of volunteer sunchoke plants appeared all around the circle garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/sunchoke-volunteers-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Volunteer sunchokes all over the garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

      &lt;p&gt;
        I've made a huge mistake.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only were there a ton clustered around where I had planted the sunchokes the previous year, but seedlings were also showing up as far as five feet away.
Turns out those rhizomes had placed little tubers all over the place, ready to colonize.
By this time, I had seeded the circle garden with native plants, and while sunchokes are technically a native, I didn’t want them to dominate this area like they were clearly prepared to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you fight a sunchoke infestation?
It’s not easy, but it’s possible.
Mowing is an option, but it would have to be done very regularly to be effective—the sunchokes didn’t mind being cut back and would quickly regrow.
Mulching would probably work, but I suspect it would have to be a very impenetrable layer to foil these vigorous plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose a war of attrition, making frequent patrols throughout the summer to pull up every sunchoke plant I found in the area.
More would sprout, and a week later I’d pull them up again.
When I had time, I’d also use a trowel to dig out the tubers themselves so they couldn’t just send up a new stem.
This strategy did eventually work, but it took a whole summer of regular attention before I got things under control.
I probably spent more time on this than on all the other weeding I’ve done in this garden in its whole existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn’t let this ordeal put me off of growing sunchokes, and I have since planted some elsewhere that are now one of my favorite and most productive crops.
You should consider growing sunchokes too, but learn from my mistakes: grow a named cultivar, and situate it somewhere that is easy to control the spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retirement&quot;&gt;Retirement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 2018 growing season, I had established a large permanent vegetable garden elsewhere in the yard and no longer needed the circle space for food.
So now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t (and still don’t) have a strong vision for this part of the yard.
It’s on the side of our house and visible from the kitchen window, so Katherine wants something pretty to look at while she washes dishes.
We want a small open area for lounging in the sun, but I had no desire to convert all of it back into grass (I hate grass).
We could eventually want to use this space for something specific, like a playhouse, a picnic table, a… dog palace?
Something.
With the future use a question mark, I didn’t want to plant it up with very permanent stuff like fruit trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to take the path of least resistance.
The grass areas around the circle would remain grass for the moment, and I would plant the circle up with something pretty, rabbit-resistant, and low maintenance.
A native plant prairie seemed like the perfect choice.
It would look nice, it wouldn’t need much care, and since we weren’t using the space for anything else, it would be put to work providing food and habitat for native insects.
With the vegetable garden nearby, it would also provide an enticing hangout spot for predator insects who help control pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the native plants in the rain garden, I had taken a focused, careful approach, buying starts and laying them out according to a thoughtful design plan.
There was to be none of that here.
I’d put down a bunch of seed and whatever grew, grew.
There were also a few perennial food plants–rhubarb, green onions, and perennial arugula–that I left in place, figuring they could wait until I had some other permanent place to move them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a packet of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/pollinator-palooza-prairie-seed-mix-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;Pollinator Palooza seed mix&lt;/a&gt; from Prairie Moon.
As recommended, I sowed the seeds in early winter, right as one of our first major snowfalls arrived.
Many native seeds need “cold stratification” to break dormancy, so letting them winter in place is the way to achieve that with the least effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring 2018 was a pretty weird season.
The snow and cold hung around a long time, and then the weather turned on a dime to immediately become hot, dry, summer conditions.
I suspect this wasn’t helpful to the seeds, who didn’t have a cool moist transition period to germinate and start establishing.
The outcome that year did not look very good.
Other than some black-eyed susans, very few native plants showed up and I was concerned that the prairie planting had been a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I didn’t care enough to intervene, and 2019 proved much more successful.
Quite a few more natives appeared and the space started to fill in, making the threat of weeds less pressing.
We got some nice flowers, not only from the robust and ever-adventurous black-eyed susans, but from some more unusual participants like figwort and native pasture thistle.&lt;/p&gt;

        It’s called “bee balm” for a reason!
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did virtually no weeding or maintenance on it the entire year, and yet almost every plant I could identify was a native.
It seems that the natives, now fully established, have thoroughly out-competed the weeds.
This was always the plan in theory, but seeing it take place in practice was very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I realized I had put shockingly little work into establishing this area in general.
I had done a bit of weeding in the first two years, mostly of pesky sow thistle, but really very little time in the grand scheme of things.
The only major time investment was fighting back sunchokes, a problem of my own making.
I was probably helped somewhat by not having major weed pressure to begin with, but still, this result feels like a big win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty bucks and some patience got me an area that doesn’t need mowing, looks pretty, and provides a huge boost of biodiversity.
The wild and slightly unruly nature of it wouldn’t work in every situation (this year, notably, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prairiemoon.com/gaura-biennis-biennial-gaura-prairie-moon-nursery.html&quot;&gt;gaura&lt;/a&gt; grew about 7 feet tall and then epically flopped over), but in this spot it works great.
Also, the dog likes to bushwhack through this area for no obvious reason.
I swear part of the appeal for her is that if she gets into the middle, the plants are thick enough she’s completely hidden from sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whirligig&quot;&gt;Whirligig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a year, Katherine travels to rural Wisconsin to attend a barn dance.
On her way there, she passes &lt;a href=&quot;http://cottagegardenfarm.com/&quot;&gt;a garden store&lt;/a&gt; that is known in the area for making outstanding whirligigs.
Seriously.
You probably thought all whirligigs were about the same quality, but that’s just because you’ve never encountered a truly exemplary whirligig before.
These ones spin effortlessly and come with a lifetime rebalancing guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussion, we agreed to invest in a whirligig, so on her next Wisconsin trip Katherine brought one home.
We didn’t have a specific spot in mind for it, but we tried it out in the prairie area and thought it fit in very nicely, so it lives there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/resized/whirligig-1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The whirligig in the middle of the prairie garden&quot; srcset=&quot;

 https://house.youngram.net/assets/images/the-first-year-garden/whirligig.jpg 1561w&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue we have is that suicidal figwort plants keep trying to grow directly into the spinning blades and get all chewed up, so we have to keep trimming them back.
We even moved it to a different spot and somehow a new figwort appeared and dove right into the blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;single-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Garden" /><summary type="html">I had maintained a small garden at both of the last two places we rented, so now that we had a place of our own I was excited to get a garden going. However, we closed on the house at the end of April, and were consumed with moving and some of the more pressing move-in issues after that. The timeline meant that I wasn’t going to have time to do almost any prep work before planting time rolled around.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Basement Egress</title><link href="https://house.youngram.net/basement-egress.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Basement Egress" /><published>2020-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://house.youngram.net/basement-egress</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://house.youngram.net/basement-egress.html">&lt;p&gt;The basement was mostly finished when we bought the house.
It still needs drywall and ceiling and a few other finishing touches, but it was already waterproofed, insulated, and had a new cement floor with in-floor hydronic heat.
Time will tell if we actually take advantage of it being finished or continue to use it as a basement, like we’re doing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ready it for use as a finished space, the final important component was an egress window.
This would allow us to have a legal bedroom down there, which is what would give the biggest boost to our property values or whatever.
Beyond looking good on paper, an egress window provides straightforward functional benefits.
It brings a lot more light into the space and makes it feel more like a room and less like a dark basement.
It also gives you a way to escape in case of fire, which is sort of the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of immediate impact on our life, an egress window wasn’t at the top of the priority list.
However, we knew that given the nature of the project we’d make it easier on ourselves if we got it done soon.
Bringing digging machinery into the yard would become more difficult once we had a full fence, and the work itself would be likely to damage any landscaping around the site.
Since a fence and major landscaping were both in the cards for the coming year, it seemed prudent to get our hardscaping out of the way while it was still simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two candidate windows along the north wall of the basement.
They are both framed out as if the original intent was to convert them to egress windows.
We thought about doing both, but that would have doubled the cost and not doubled the benefits.
A single egress window seemed like the best balance for our needs.
One of the windows was situated in a more likely spot for a future bedroom, plus it was a simpler section of wall (the other window sits in a bump-out where the first floor bay window follows down into the foundation), so it got the nod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a couple quotes but didn’t look very hard because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egresswindowguy.com/&quot;&gt;Egress Window Guy&lt;/a&gt; seemed like an easy choice.
They get a lot of good reviews on Nextdoor and Angie’s List.
They specialize in this one thing so the whole planning and quoting process is very streamlined.
Their prices are reasonable, and better yet, they have a standardized price sheet for all their options so I was able to get a very straightforward apples-to-apples comparison on the cost differences between various options.
Also, they offer a discount if you obtain an online quote by filling out a questionnaire and sending photos so they can save a site visit.
My kind of people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the effort that goes into an egress window isn’t the window itself, it’s digging a big old hole in the ground for the egress.
It was a two person operation: they brought in a mini-excavator and two wheelbarrows and one person operated the scoop while the other basically ran back and forth carrying loads of dirt to the area I had designated.
He’d run one wheelbarrow to the dirt pile while the other one was being filled, then run it back, swap for the full one, and start again.
That guy must sleep well at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a six-foot hole dug in your yard is a good opportunity to learn about the soil profile.
Once I showed interest, the guy doing the digging helpfully told me about what he had noticed.
Apparently we have a couple feet of good topsoil, then a heavy clay layer, then underneath that is fairly sandy subsoil.
Weird, but not too bad.
This was timely information as well, since I was very shortly installing a rain garden in the same side of the lawn.
In the end we get good enough drainage through the clay layer that I haven’t needed to do anything special, but if our rain garden wasn’t draining quickly, I would have considered trying to dig or punch holes through the clay, knowing that there was well-draining sand underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

        Getting the hole ready. This isn't even most of the dirt; note the trodden path leading away from it.
        
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the hole was dug, it was just a matter of sawing through the concrete block foundation and installing a window opening.
I was busy with other stuff so I didn’t pay a lot of attention to this part, but they moved pretty fast.
The whole thing took about two thirds of a work day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was glad we made the decision to do this piece early, because it was somewhat disruptive to the site, as expected.
The crew was very respectful and did their best not to mess up the surrounding area, but digging a big hole is always going to create a bit of havoc.
It didn’t help that the ground still had melting snow on it (thanks, April of Endless Winter).
The mini-excavator left some tracks driving in, and the path used by the beleaguered wheelbarrow shuttle-man got pretty trampled and compacted.
If I already had nice landscaping in the area they were working, I would have been stressed out by this project.
As it was, the whole area was just crappy grass that was due to be torn up and converted shortly anyhow, so I didn’t mind at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t pay extra to have the dirt disposed of, so we were left with a small mountain on our back patio.
A lesson I’ve learned a couple times now: you’re always going to generate way more dirt than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did eventually relocate it all to other places around the yard, but it took us most of a year to slowly chip away at it.
I had planned to use the dirt to regrade a section of the yard near the foundation, but that didn’t make nearly as big a dent as I had expected.
A lot of it went to leveling out a low spot  in the back yard, and some more went to slightly raising the profile of the new planting areas I put in along the fence in back.
The clay subsoil was the hardest thing to use up, as it was heavy enough to not perform well in planting beds.
That eventually led to the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;/the-mud-head.html&quot;&gt;my great ephemeral masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess I just needed to take the whole journey to reach the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished window looks very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the details of the window options but we got an Anderson 400 Series, I believe because it was a step up from the basic option and my research suggested it would do an acceptable job.
We splashed out for the more spendy timber lining on the well itself instead of a basic galvanized metal sheet.
I’m very glad we did, even though it raised the price considerably.
A window with a galvanized well would be &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; and would do the job adequately, but I don’t think it would actually make the room better.
The timber well is attractive enough that the window becomes an asset and really adds to the ambiance of the room.
It’s also much prettier from the outside.
Galvanized wells are always a little funky and tend to feel like something you want to screen, while this one serves as a feature in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

        The timber well meshes wonderfully with the new landscaping.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider opening also lets in more light and gives a feeling of expansiveness from inside.
This part of the basement feels a lot cheerier than it did with the small dim window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the window installed, the only thing left for me to do was finish the interior trim, so I got right to work.
Ha ha!
Just kidding, it’s been three years and I haven’t touched it.
I only took the stickers off the window just now to take this photo.
When we finish the rest of the basement, we’ll finish the window interior.
Until then, it just isn’t a priority.
It’s still the best-looking part of the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

Time will tell if we actually take advantage of it being finished or continue to use it as a basement, like we’re doing now.</summary></entry></feed>
