Just a quick note for the dedicated readers: this blog will now be hosted at [house.youngram.net](https://house.youngram.net).
It was previously hosted at house.youngram.com, so if you have it bookmarked, update your bookmarks.
Someone contacted me with an offer to sell the youngram.com domain and offered enough money to make it worth my while, so that domain will soon be leaving my control.
If you get this newsletter by email, you will be unaffected.

What will become of youngram.com?
I don't know!
The buyer is working through a domain broker so I don't know their identity, and I am deeply curious to see what it is used for.

There's been a lot going on in our lives, thus the lack of recent content.
The blog isn't scuttled, though!
I've got some good stuff in the pipeline, and will hopefully be publishing some new posts in the near future.
